F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	"I can't bear it!" and over went her head on the music rack.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	"So I hope," said mrs Whitney; "and father, I do believe they'll repay you; for I do think there's good blood there; these children have a look about them that shows them worthy to be trusted."
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	"Oh!" she cried, coming out of her rapture a little, and springing over to mr King with Phronsie still in her arms.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	"I can't play with you like a little boy any more," he said slowly.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	"I don't know," said Van, running over in his mind all the possible ways he could think of for entertaining anybody, "unless she'd like my new book of travels-or my velocipede," he added.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	"Do you like mr Linstrum?" Marie asked suddenly.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	When Emil reached the lower corner by the hedge, Marie was sitting under her white mulberry tree, the pailful of cherries beside her, looking off at the gentle, tireless swelling of the wheat.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	So, with a great many chucklings and shruggings when no one was by, he had departed after breakfast one day, simply saying he shouldn't be back to lunch.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	His yellow canvas leggings and khaki trousers were splashed to the knees.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	The grain is so heavy that it bends toward the blade and cuts like velvet.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	His wife now lies beside him, and the white shaft that marks their graves gleams across the wheat fields.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	Emil took a step nearer and stood frowning down at her bent head. He stood in an attitude of self defense, his feet well apart, his hands clenched and drawn up at his sides, so that the cords stood out on his bare arms.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	I pray for you, but that's not the same as if you prayed yourself."
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	One room is papered, carpeted, over furnished; the next is almost bare.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	Frank read English slowly, and the more he read about this divorce case, the angrier he grew.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	They drove westward toward Norway Creek, and toward a big white house that stood on a hill, several miles across the fields.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	All Angelique's folks are baking for it, and all Amedee's twenty cousins.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	"She's the cunningest little thing I ever saw," said mrs Whitney, enthusiastically, afterward, aside to mr King.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	She ran into the house, put on a short skirt and a pair of her husband's boots, caught up a tin pail and started for the orchard.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	I get wet to my knees when I go down to pick cherries."
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	"Free thinkers," replied the young woman laconically.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	Unconscious respect, probably, for he seemed intent upon his own thoughts, and, like the Gladiator's, they were far away.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	On either side of the road, for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill, stood tall osage orange hedges, their glossy green marking off the yellow fields.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	The old wild country, the struggle in which his sister was destined to succeed while so many men broke their hearts and died, he can scarcely remember.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	"I'm sure Alexandra hopes you will stay on here," she murmured.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	"Now you'll stay," cried Van; "say, Polly, won't you."
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	And, anyhow, there's nothing to understand!" She struck the ground with her little foot fiercely.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	The space between his two front teeth, which were unusually far apart, gave him the proficiency in whistling for which he was distinguished at college. (He also played the cornet in the University band.)
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	I'm a good Catholic, but I think I could get along with caring for trees, if I hadn't anything else."
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	"Aren't you glad I've come, Polly?" asked Phronsie, with her little face close to Polly's own.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	"Well," said mrs Whitney, softly, "let's think what we can do for Polly; it makes me feel very badly to see her sad little face."
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	If you had any eyes, you would see that she is very fond of him.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	Then he went on in a low tone, so intense that it was almost threatening: "Sometimes you seem to understand perfectly, and then sometimes you pretend you don't.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	Supposing that it was his sister coming back from one of her farms, he kept on with his work.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	He turned to his farm hand who was reading the other half of the paper.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	Listen here what he do wit his money." And Frank began the catalogue of the young man's reputed extravagances.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	He reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet, insipid fruit,--long ivory colored berries, tipped with faint pink, like white coral, that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	When I heard it raining in the night, I thought maybe you would come and do it for me to day.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	South of the apricot trees, cornering on the wheatfield, was Frank's alfalfa, where myriads of white and yellow butterflies were always fluttering above the purple blossoms.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	After he was gone, Marie went out to the back porch to begin her butter making. A brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across the sky.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	She had grown very pale and her eyes were shining with excitement and distress. "But, Emil, if I understand, then all our good times are over, we can never do nice things together any more.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	I like trees because they seem more resigned to the way they have to live than other things do.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	"Is her name Phronsie," put in Dick, unwilling to be left out, and not thinking of anything else to ask.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	In printing the story of the young man's marital troubles, the knowing editor gave a sufficiently colored account of his career, stating the amount of his income and the manner in which he was supposed to spend it.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	"Dear me!" ejaculated the old gentleman, in the utmost amazement; "and such a time as I've had to get her here too!" he added, staring around on the astonished group, none of whom had a word to say.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	"Boys," whispered their mother, warningly, "she can't answer you; just look at her face."
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	It will go away, and things will be just as they used to. I wish you were a Catholic.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	Oh, I don't mean all of them, I mean that low place down by my tree, where there are so many.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	It's then that I want to pull the corners of the Divide together.
F0/reference_wav/F0_ref.wav	"So you see, I was just in time; in the very nick of time, in fact!"
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	The spot of earth which the goddess chose had the best of climates, and produced the wisest men; in no other was she herself, the philosopher and warrior goddess, so likely to have votaries.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	Socrates begins the Timaeus with a summary of the Republic.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	Two kinds of motion were assigned to them-first, the revolution in the same and around the same, in peaceful unchanging thought of the same; and to this was added a forward motion which was under the control of the same.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	'In mind,' replied the priest, 'I mean to say that you are children; there is no opinion or tradition of knowledge among you which is white with age; and I will tell you why.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	Is the world created or uncreated?--that is the first question.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	The body of heaven is visible, but the soul is invisible, and partakes of reason and harmony, and is the best of creations, being the work of the best.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	Thus was time made in the image of the eternal nature; and it was created together with the heavens, in order that if they were dissolved, it might perish with them.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	That which is bound may be dissolved, but only an evil being would dissolve that which is harmonious and happy.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	What is spoken of the unchanging or intelligible must be certain and true; but what is spoken of the created image can only be probable; being is to becoming what truth is to belief.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	For there occurs at long intervals a derangement of the heavenly bodies, and then the earth is destroyed by fire.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	A little while afterwards there were great earthquakes and floods, and your warrior race all sank into the earth; and the great island of Atlantis also disappeared in the sea.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	When all of them, both those who show themselves in the sky, and those who retire from view, had come into being, the Creator addressed them thus:--'Gods, sons of gods, my works, if I will, are indissoluble.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	But two terms must be united by a third, which is a mean between them; and had the earth been a surface only, one mean would have sufficed, but two means are required to unite solid bodies.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	But when the visual ray goes forth into the darkness, then unlike falls upon unlike-the eye no longer sees, and we go to sleep.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	'I see,' replied Socrates, 'that I shall be well entertained; and do you, Timaeus, offer up a prayer and begin.'
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	They first contrived the eyes, into which they conveyed a light akin to the light of day, making it flow through the pupils.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	SOCRATES: Excellent, Timaeus, I like your manner of approaching the subject-proceed.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	The sight of them and their revolutions has given us the knowledge of number and time, the power of enquiry, and philosophy, which is the great blessing of human life; not to speak of the lesser benefits which even the vulgar can appreciate.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	Sight is the source of the greatest benefits to us; for if our eyes had never seen the sun, stars, and heavens, the words which we have spoken would not have been uttered.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	TIMAEUS: Why did the Creator make the world?...He was good, and therefore not jealous, and being free from jealousy he desired that all things should be like himself.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	The most famous of them all was the overthrow of the island of Atlantis.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	And God created them according to the patterns or species of them which existed in the divine original.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	But in Egypt the traditions of our own and other lands are by us registered for ever in our temples.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	These swelling and surging as in a river moved irregularly and irrationally in all the six possible ways, forwards, backwards, right, left, up and down.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	And when external impressions enter in, they are really conquered, though they seem to conquer.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	And although you are not immortal you shall not die, for I will hold you together.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	Wherefore he made an image of eternity which is time, having an uniform motion according to number, parted into months and days and years, and also having greater divisions of past, present, and future.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	Of the second or concurrent causes of sight I have already spoken, and I will now speak of the higher purpose of God in giving us eyes.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	The occasion of the rehearsal was the day of the Apaturia called the Registration of Youth, at which our parents gave prizes for recitation.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	He lightly touches upon a few points,--the division of labour and distribution of the citizens into classes, the double nature and training of the guardians, the community of property and of women and children.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	The outer circle or sphere was named the sphere of the same-the inner, the sphere of the other or diverse; and the one revolved horizontally to the right, the other diagonally to the left.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	By reason of these affections the soul is at first without intelligence, but as time goes on the stream of nutriment abates, and the courses of the soul regain their proper motion, and apprehend the same and the other rightly, and become rational.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	Thus arose day and night, which are the periods of the most intelligent nature; a month is created by the revolution of the moon, a year by that of the sun
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	Are there many worlds or one only?--that is the fourth question...One only.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	And as the world was composed of solids, between the elements of fire and earth God placed two other elements of air and water, and arranged them in a continuous proportion-
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	For if in the original there had been more than one they would have been the parts of a third, which would have been the true pattern of the world; and therefore there is, and will ever be, but one created world.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	Now that which is created is of necessity corporeal and visible and tangible,--visible and therefore made of fire,--tangible and therefore solid and made of earth.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	The memory of them was lost, because there was no written voice among you.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	And since this was controlled by the movement of the same, the seven planets in their courses appeared to describe spirals; and that appeared fastest which was slowest, and that which overtook others appeared to be overtaken by them.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	Nine thousand years have elapsed since she founded yours, and eight thousand since she founded ours, as our annals record.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	There are four of them: one of gods, another of birds, a third of fishes, and a fourth of animals.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	The soul was first made by him-the elder to rule the younger; not in the order in which our wayward fancy has led us to describe them, but the soul first and afterwards the body.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	and so put together a visible and palpable heaven, having harmony and friendship in the union of the four elements; and being at unity with itself it was indissoluble except by the hand of the framer.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	Critias when he told this tale of the olden time, was ninety years old, I being not more than ten.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	This mighty power was arrayed against Egypt and Hellas and all the countries bordering on the Mediterranean.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	The earth, which is our nurse, clinging around the pole extended through the universe, he made to be the guardian and artificer of night and day, first and eldest of gods that are in the interior of heaven.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	Hear me, then:--Three tribes of mortal beings have still to be created, but if created by me they would be like gods.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	Now the Nile is our saviour from fire, and as there is little rain in Egypt, we are not harmed by water; whereas in other countries, when a deluge comes, the inhabitants are swept by the rivers into the sea.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	Then your city did bravely, and won renown over the whole earth.
F1/reference_wav/F1_ref.wav	And there you dwelt as became the children of the gods, excelling all men in virtue, and many famous actions are recorded of you.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	He would say good night, but not good bye.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	Philip therefore read diligently in the Astor library, planned literary works that should compel attention, and nursed his genius.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	This excellent advice did not seem to impress ruth greatly, for she was looking away with that abstraction of vision which often came into her grey eyes, and at length she exclaimed, with a sort of impatience,
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	"Thy ways greatly try me, ruth, and all thy relations.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	I heard father tell cousin Abner that he was whipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined to have what compensation he could get now."
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	"Mother; thee knows I couldn't stand it at Westfield; the school stifled me, it's a place to turn young people into dried fruit."
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	"Somewhat that depends upon whether her children amount to anything," retorted the sharp little disputant.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	The rather common place and unformed hand writing seemed to him peculiar and characteristic, different from that of any other woman.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	"What's the good, father, of a series of human beings who don't advance any?"
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	Philip liked the letter, as he did everything she did; but he had a dim notion that there was more about herself in the letter than about him.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	Why should I rust, and be stupid, and sit in inaction because I am a girl? What would happen to me if thee should lose thy property and die?
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	"Thee has another letter from young Sterling," said Eli Bolton.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	"Mother," said ruth calmly, "I have thought it all over.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	It was settled therefore, in the prompt way in which things are settled in New York, that they would start with the rest of the company next morning for the west.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	If he returned with a fortune, perhaps and perhaps.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	He had no friend wise enough to tell him to step into the Dorking Convention, then in session, make a sketch of the men and women on the platform, and take it to the editor of the Daily Grapevine, and see what he could get a line for it.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	ruth turned square round to her mother, and with an impassive face and not the slightest change of tone, said,
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	What is there to fear in a person dead more than in a person living?"
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	But Philip did afford it, and he wrote, thanking his friends, and declining because he said the political scheme would fail, and ought to fail.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	It was in this time of rather impatient waiting that Philip was one morning walking down Broadway with Henry Brierly.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	And the lectures, and the dissecting rooms, has thee thought of the dissecting rooms?"
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	That evening ruth and her father sat late by the drawing room fire, as they were quite apt to do at night.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	He has no traditions to bind him or guide him, and his impulse is to break away from the occupation his father has followed, and make a new way for himself.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	Philip had a good appetite, a sunny temper, and a clear hearty laugh.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	"He doesn't say, but it's on the frontier, and on the map everything beyond it is marked 'Indians' and 'desert,' and looks as desolate as a Wednesday Meeting."
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	He knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he had at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	"Take it of course," says Gringo, "take anything that offers, why not?"
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	"O, very well," said Gringo, turning away with a shade of contempt, "you'll find if you are going into literature and newspaper work that you can't afford a conscience like that."
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	Philip wrote a long letter, first of all, to his mother, full of love and glowing anticipations of his new opening.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	On the way up town these adventurers bought books on engineering, and suits of India rubber, which they supposed they would need in a new and probably damp country, and many other things which nobody ever needed anywhere.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	If they disapprove, thought he, I've done my duty by letting them know.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	He had brown hair, hazel eyes set wide apart, a broad but not high forehead, and a fresh winning face.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	The fact was, though Philip Sterling did not know it, that he wanted several other things quite as much as he wanted wealth.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	Happy youth, that is ready to pack its valise, and start for Cathay on an hour's notice.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	Her sisters had gone to the city to show some country visitors Independence Hall, Girard College and Fairmount Water Works and Park, four objects which Americans cannot die peacefully, even in Naples, without having seen.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	He might never see her again; he went to seek his fortune.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	To his uncle he said that he had made an arrangement with some New York capitalists to go to Missouri, in a land and railroad operation, which would at least give him a knowledge of the world and not unlikely offer him a business opening.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	"I want to be something, to make myself something, to do something.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	He wanted to be rich, he had a sincere desire for a fortune, but for some unaccountable reason he hesitated about addressing himself to the narrow work of getting it.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	And he went back to his books and to his waiting for an opening large enough for his dignified entrance into the literary world.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	But there was no real danger to a person who took care of himself.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	What one useful thing could I do for a living, for the support of mother and the children?
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	He wouldn't bother her with business details, but he hoped that the day was not far off when she would see him return, with a moderate fortune, and something to add to the comfort of her advancing years.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	"If thee wants to see new bonnets, orthodox to a shade and conformed to the letter of the true form, thee must go to the Arch Street Meeting.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	Will there not always be rosin enough for the squeaking fiddle bow?
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	Delightful illusion of paint and tinsel and silk attire, of cheap sentiment and high and mighty dialogue!
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	If they were orphans, would they like to be brought up in a Grecian temple?
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	That party is going to succeed, it's going to elect the next president."
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	The sight seers returned in high spirits from the city.
F2/reference_wav/F2_ref.wav	Indeed, they lived together in Ninth Street, in a boarding house, there, which had the honor of lodging and partially feeding several other young fellows of like kidney, who have since gone their several ways into fame or into obscurity.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	We will make a little tour together, when all this shall have blown over, in a few weeks, and choose our retreat; and with the winter's snow we'll vanish from Brandon, and appear with the early flowers at our cottage among the beautiful woods and hills of Wales.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	'Rachel, dear, you have not told my secret?'
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	'Rachel, dear, I'm so glad to see you,' said Dorcas, placing her arms gently about her neck, and kissing her twice or thrice.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	There was a bright moonlight, broken by the shadows of overhanging boughs and withered leaves; and the mottled lights and shadows glided oddly across his pale features.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	It is quite understood. It was all, you know, old Lady Chelford's arrangement: and Dorcas is so supine, I believe she would allow herself to be given away by anyone, and to anyone, rather than be at the least trouble.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	But poor Rachel Lake had more than that stoical hypocrisy which enables the tortured spirits of her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smile.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	I see-to be sure-really, Wylder, it does your taste infinite credit.'
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	I really can't tell; but he'll soon tire of country life.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	It was not very much past eleven that morning when the pony carriage from Brandon drew up before the little garden wicket of Redman's Farm.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	The portion of it which the carpet did not cover showed it to be oak, dark and rugged.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	'Thank you, Rachel, my Cousin Rachel, my only friend.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	'You have been more ill than I thought, darling, and you are still far from quite recovered.'
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	She was up and dressed, and this moment coming down, and would be very happy to see Miss Brandon, if she would step into the drawing room.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	'Never mind, Wylder, it's the winning card,' said Lord Chelford, laying his hand on his shoulder.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	'Fie, Lake, there's no poetry in you,' said Lord Chelford, laughing.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	Oh! Dorcas, darling, don't forsake me; I am very lonely here and my spirits are gone and I never needed kindness so much before.'
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	You resemble me, Rachel: you are fearless and inflexible and generous.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	It seemed to me to indicate a great deal more than mere indifference-something of aversion, and nearer to a positive emotion than anything I had yet seen in that exquisitely apathetic face.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	'I take that for granted: in the nature of things it can hardly be otherwise,' I replied, a good deal startled and perplexed by the curious audacity of her interrogatory.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	'Can I conjecture why he is gone?' murmured Rachel, still gazing with a wild kind of apathy into distance.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	Remember I am neither well nor happy, and forgive what you cannot like in me.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	'Shake hands with your cousin, my dear,' said old Lady Chelford, peremptorily.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	'By the bye, Wylder, you know the pictures here; who is the tall man, with the long pale face, and wild phosphoric eyes?
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	By this time Lord Chelford and Wylder returned; and, disgusted rather with myself, I ruminated on my want of general ship.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	But don't these very wise things sometimes turn out very foolishly?
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	'Now that's impossible, Radie; for I really don't think I once thought of him all this evening-except just while we were talking.'
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	'I don't know; but I think he mentioned Larkins's house, didn't he?
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	Whereupon Lake laughed quietly, still looking on the ace of hearts with his sly eyes.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	The fact is, Captain Lake, an accomplished player, made a pretty little revenue of Sir Harry's billiards, which were wild and noisy; and liking his money, thought he liked himself-a confusion not uncommon.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	'I believe, Charlie,' he recommenced suddenly, 'there is not such an unnatural family on record as ours; is there?
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	She was so unreserved, it seemed, and yet in this directness there was something almost contemptuous.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	I don't know who's my cousin, or who isn't; nor you don't, who've been for ten years over those d-d papers; but I think he's the nastiest dog I ever met.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	There was something of sweetness and fondness in her tones and manner, which was new to Rachel, and comforting, and she returned the greeting as kindly, and felt more like her former self.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	'Did you see that?' said Wylder in my ear, with a chuckle; and, wagging his head, he added, rather loftily for him, 'Miss Brandon, I reckon, has taken your measure, Master Stanley, as well as i I wonder what the deuce the old dowager sees in him.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	he'll soon be back in town, or to Brighton,' I said.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	My mother could tell us all about it-we, Brandons, Lakes; Wylders, and Chelfords.'
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	He was going to marry the gamekeeper's daughter, it was thought, and he and the old boy, who was for high blood, and all that, were at loggerheads about it.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	'I really don't think Wylder cares twopence about her, or she about him,' and Stanley Lake laughed gently and sleepily.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	I thought of the 'Fair Brunnisende,' with the captive knight in the hands of her seneschal before her, and I fancied he said something of having found him trespassing in her town, and brought him up for judgment.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	That spirit belongs to the blood of our strange race; all our women were so.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	Miss Rachel only glanced across her mufflers on his face.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	Their walk continued silent for the greater part, neither was quite satisfied with the other.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	There was something evil and shrinking in his aspect, which I felt with a sort of chill, like the commencing fascination of a serpent.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	'I'm glad you like it,' says Wylder, chuckling benignantly on it, over his shoulder.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	A little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney, and startled me confoundedly.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	'Dorcas, you are changed; have I lost your love for asking so poor a kindness?'
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	'You know Captain Lake?' said Lord Chelford, addressing me.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	I did not even take the precaution of smoking up the chimney.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	Wylder was laughing rather redly, with the upper part of his face very surly, I thought.
F3/reference_wav/F3_ref.wav	If a fellow's been a little bit wild, he's Beelzebub at once. Bracton's a very good fellow, I can assure you.'
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	"Besides," I mused, "all roads lead home to Europe, and our unicorn may be gracious enough to take me toward the coast of France!
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	We're going to rid the seas of it! The author of a two volume work, in quarto, on The Mysteries of the Great Ocean Depths has no excuse for not setting sail with Commander Farragut.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	The Poles were quashed with a violence that appalled not only Verne but all Europe.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	As to advertising him, john gave it as his opinion that they would be ashamed to do it from the fact that they had already rendered themselves more notorious than they had bargained for, on account of their cruelty towards their slaves; they were wealthy, and courted the good opinion of society.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	Anyhow, we'll leave instructions to ship the whole menagerie to France.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	The archaeotherium, hyracotherium, oreodonts, cheiropotamus, and master's other fossil skeletons?"
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	CABLE LENGTH In Verne's context, six hundred feet
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	"With all due respect to master," Conseil replied, "as comfortable as a hermit crab inside the shell of a whelk."
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	- MILLIMETER Roughly one twenty fifth of an inch
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	I left Conseil to the proper stowing of our luggage and climbed on deck to watch the preparations for getting under way.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	Three seconds after reading this letter from the honorable Secretary of the Navy, I understood at last that my true vocation, my sole purpose in life, was to hunt down this disturbing monster and rid the world of it.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	LEAGUE In Verne's context, two point one six miles
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	"These Johnsons thought that they were first rate to their servants.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	The Abraham Lincoln had been perfectly chosen and fitted out for its new assignment.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	- KILOMETER Roughly six tenths of a mile
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	- MILLIGRAM Roughly one twenty eight thousandth of an ounce
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	"Conseil!" I called in an impatient voice.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	I always had it in my mind to leave, but I was 'jubus', (dubious?) of starting.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	Initially, Verne's narrative was influenced by the eighteen sixty three uprising of Poland against Tsarist Russia.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	This notwithstanding, Verne furnishes the most evocative portrayal of the ocean depths before the arrival of Jacques Cousteau and technicolor film.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	The hotel elevator dropped us off in the main vestibule on the mezzanine. I went down a short stair leading to the ground floor. I settled my bill at that huge counter that was always under siege by a considerable crowd.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	From the manner in which he expressed himself, with regard to Robert Hollan, no man in the whole range of his recollections will be longer remembered than he; his enthralment while under Hollan will hardly ever be forgotten.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	And Verne's marine engineering proves especially authoritative.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	Yet this loose structure gives the novel an air of documentary realism.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	To be sure, I had confidence in this devoted lad.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	That his master was a man of "means and pretty high standing"--Julius thought was not much to his credit since they were obtained from unpaid labor.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	A route slightly less direct, that's all. We're leaving on the Abraham Lincoln."
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	I left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dried plants to Paris, France.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	Lincoln until it reached the waters of the Hudson River, at the tip of the long peninsula that forms New York City.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	I bowed, and letting the commander attend to getting under way, I was taken to the cabin that had been set aside for me.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	We've seen progress in sonar, torpedoes, and other belligerent machinery, but sailors and scientists- to say nothing of tourists-have yet to voyage in a submarine with the luxury and efficiency of the Nautilus.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	Lastly the book has stature as a novel of character.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	I wanted nothing more than to see my country again, my friends, my modest quarters by the Botanical Gardens, my dearly beloved collections!
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	Julius' color was nearly jet black, and his speech was very good considering his lack of book learning; his bearing was entirely self possessed and commendable.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	He hated everything like Slavery, and as young as he was, he had already made five attempts to escape.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	Julius, who was successful enough to bring his wife and boy with him, was a wonderful specimen of muscular proportions.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	j b Parlett's advertisement, gave his views of the man who had enslaved him.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	The treatment that had been meted out to them was about as tolerant as Slavery could well afford; and the physical condition of the passengers bore evidence that they had been used to something better than herring and corn cake for a diet.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	This was what did the mischief so far as the "running away" was concerned.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	While this party was very respectable in regard to numbers and enlisted much sympathy, still they had no wounds or bruises to exhibit, or very hard reports to make relative to their bondage.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	Other subtleties occur inside each episode, the textures sparkling with wit, information, and insight.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	These unifying threads tighten the narrative and accelerate its momentum.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	When asked what first prompted him to seek his freedom, he replied, "Oh my senses!
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	His wife and boy shared fully in his affections, and seemed well pleased to have their faces turned Canada ward.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	On this occasion, with older and wiser heads, he succeeded.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	thirty seven degrees centigrade equals human body temperature
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	I will give fifty dollars reward if taken in Baltimore city or county, and two hundred dollars if taken out of the State and secured in jail so that I get him again.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	His specifications for an open sea submarine and a self-contained diving suit were decades before their time, yet modern technology bears them out triumphantly.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	Because, as that Time cover story suggests, we still haven't caught up with Verne.
F4/reference_wav/F4_ref.wav	The escort of boats and tenders still followed the frigate and only left us when we came abreast of the lightship, whose two signal lights mark the entrance of the narrows to Upper New York Bay.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	And now my turn comes; pale and trembling under the blinding splendour and the melting heat, it drops at my feet, spinning silently round upon the deck; I try to move my foot away, but cannot.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	He has laid a firm hold upon a rope, and appears to watch with grim satisfaction this awful display of elemental strife.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	I must be bound to the mast, which bows like a reed before the mighty strength of the storm.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	His long hair blown by the pelting storm, and laid flat across his immovable countenance, makes him a strange figure; for the end of each lock of loose flowing hair is tipped with little luminous radiations.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	It must be as wide as the Mediterranean or the Atlantic-and why not?
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	They seem to be 'We are lost'; but I am not sure.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	"We are not descending as we ought to be," the Professor declares. "We are losing time, and the fact is, I have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a pond on a raft."
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	Ah! what a flood of intense and dazzling light! the globe has burst, and we are deluged with tongues of fire!
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	It rushes on from the farthest recesses of the vast cavern.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	I suppose Professor Liedenbrock was of my opinion too, and even shared my fears, for after having examined the pick, his eyes traversed the ocean from side to side.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	The wind never lulls but to acquire increased strength; the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing storms.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	Is the atmospheric condition, having once reached this density, to become final?
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	Therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects."
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning?
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	My eyes fail under the dazzling light, my ears are stunned with the incessant crash of thunder.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	We stood amazed, thunderstruck, at the presence of such a herd of marine monsters.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	The atmosphere is evidently charged and surcharged with electricity. My whole body is saturated; my hair bristles just as when you stand upon an insulated stool under the action of an electrical machine.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	Yes, indeed, those are the marks of teeth imprinted upon the metal! The jaws which they arm must be possessed of amazing strength.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	Good bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). 'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	The reptiles rose; they wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	But soon the reptile's agony draws to an end; its movements become fainter, its contortions cease to be so violent, and the long serpentine form lies a lifeless log on the labouring deep.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	I could just see my uncle at full length on the raft, and Hans still at his helm and spitting fire under the action of the electricity which has saturated him.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	"The sail! the sail!" I cry, motioning to lower it.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	I then remembered that the Professor, before starting, had estimated the length of this underground sea at thirty leagues.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	My head is still stupefied with the vivid reality of my dream.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	A suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air, it enters the throat, it fills the lungs.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is-oh dear!
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	What a very bad notion that was of his, I thought to myself, to take soundings just here!
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	The instruments, the tools, our guns, are clashing and clanking violently in their collisions with each other; the nails of my boots cling tenaciously to a plate of iron let into the timbers, and I cannot draw my foot away from the spot.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	I saw at the Hamburg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	A little bright eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair!
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	His temper is awful, to judge from the working of his features, as he sees this vast length of ocean unrolling before him to an indefinite extent.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	The struggle continues with unabated ferocity.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	It seems to me as if my companions, the moment they touched me, would receive a severe shock like that from an electric eel.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	But when the pick was shipped again, Hans pointed out on its surface deep prints as if it had been violently compressed between two hard bodies.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	Yet the deep marks of conical teeth upon the iron pick are certainly those of the crocodile.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	I am not complaining that the rate is slow, but that the sea is so wide."
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	The two beasts are fast locked together; I cannot distinguish the one from the other.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	They possessed a perfect organisation, gigantic proportions, prodigious strength.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	Only his long neck shoots up, drops again, coils and uncoils, droops, lashes the waters like a gigantic whip, and writhes like a worm that you tread on.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry about it.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	At ten in the morning the symptoms of storm become aggravated.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	But it now seems to me as if the other animals were taking part in the fray-the porpoise, the whale, the lizard, the tortoise.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	I feel peculiar sensations, like many creatures on earth at the approach of violent atmospheric changes.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	Hans pointed with his finger at a dark mass six hundred yards away, rising and falling alternately with heavy plunges.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	All at once an enormous head is darted up, the head of the plesiosaurus.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	Its body is entirely covered with a thick armour of scales, and its neck, as flexible as a swan's, rises thirty feet above the waves.
M0/reference_wav/M0_ref.wav	"At any rate we cannot feel sorry to have come so far.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	He turned seaward from the road at Dollymount and as he passed on to the thin wooden bridge he felt the planks shaking with the tramp of heavily shod feet.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	I think you, Lawless, are likely to make that mistake.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	Do you mean to say that you are not able to tell me what a surd is?
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	On Friday confession will be heard all the afternoon after beads.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	But her long fair hair was girlish: and girlish, and touched with the wonder of mortal beauty, her face.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	In the distance along the course of the slow flowing Liffey slender masts flecked the sky and, more distant still, the dim fabric of the city lay prone in haze.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	His eyelids trembled as if they felt the vast cyclic movement of the earth and her watchers, trembled as if they felt the strange light of some new world.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	How comes it that while the first beatitude promises the kingdom of heaven to the poor of heart the second beatitude promises also to the meek that they shall possess the land?
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	--Heavenly God! cried Stephen's soul, in an outburst of profane joy.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	He had sinned mortally not once but many times and he knew that, while he stood in danger of eternal damnation for the first sin alone, by every succeeding sin he multiplied his guilt and his punishment.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	A great saint, saint Francis Xavier!
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	A certain pride, a certain awe, withheld him from offering to God even one prayer at night, though he knew it was in God's power to take away his life while he slept and hurl his soul hellward ere he could beg for mercy.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	He is called, as you know, the apostle of the Indies.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	It was strange too that he found an arid pleasure in following up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church and penetrating into obscure silences only to hear and feel the more deeply his own condemnation.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	Instead the vital wave had carried him on its bosom out of himself and back again when it receded: and no part of body or soul had been maimed but a dark peace had been established between them.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	A tall boy behind Stephen rubbed his hands and said:
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	His throat ached with a desire to cry aloud, the cry of a hawk or eagle on high, to cry piercingly of his deliverance to the winds.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	A great saint, saint Francis Xavier!
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	Her eyes seemed to regard him with mild pity; her holiness, a strange light glowing faintly upon her frail flesh, did not humiliate the sinner who approached her.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	All through his boyhood he had mused upon that which he had so often thought to be his destiny and when the moment had come for him to obey the call he had turned aside, obeying a wayward instinct.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	Heron, beside Stephen, began to hum tunelessly.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	This was the call of life to his soul not the dull gross voice of the world of duties and despair, not the inhuman voice that had called him to the pale service of the altar.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	Stephen, leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler, listened to the talk about him which Heron checked from time to time by saying:
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	Ennis, who had gone to the yard, came back, saying:
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	He passed from the trembling bridge on to firm land again.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	At that instant, as it seemed to him, the air was chilled and, looking askance towards the water, he saw a flying squall darkening and crisping suddenly the tide.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	At his first violent sin he had felt a wave of vitality pass out of him and had feared to find his body or his soul maimed by the excess.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	He came of an old and illustrious Spanish family and you remember that he was one of the first followers of saint Ignatius.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	Her thighs, fuller and soft hued as ivory, were bared almost to the hips, where the white fringes of her drawers were like feathering of soft white down.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	Their feet passed in pattering tumult over his mind, the feet of hares and rabbits, the feet of harts and hinds and antelopes, until he heard them no more and remembered only a proud cadence from Newman:
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	The rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson from.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	He would follow a devious course up and down the streets, circling always nearer and nearer in a tremor of fear and joy, until his feet led him suddenly round a dark corner.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	--Whose feet are as the feet of harts and underneath the everlasting arms.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	He drew forth a phrase from his treasure and spoke it softly to himself:
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	After early nightfall the yellow lamps would light up, here and there, the squalid quarter of the brothels.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	At most, by an alms given to a beggar whose blessing he fled from, he might hope wearily to win for himself some measure of actual grace.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	The pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the dignity of the office he had refused.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	They were voyaging across the deserts of the sky, a host of nomads on the march, voyaging high over Ireland, westward bound.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	He set off abruptly for the Bull, walking rapidly lest his father's shrill whistle might call him back; and in a few moments he had rounded the curve at the police barrack and was safe.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	Disheartened, he raised his eyes towards the slow drifting clouds, dappled and seaborne.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	So timeless seemed the grey warm air, so fluid and impersonal his own mood, that all ages were as one to him.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	It was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them, to tell himself that if he ever came to their gates, stripped of his pride, beaten and in beggar's weeds, that they would be generous towards him, loving him as themselves.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	The music came nearer and he recalled the words, the words of Shelley's fragment upon the moon wandering companionless, pale for weariness.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	A squad of christian brothers was on its way back from the Bull and had begun to pass, two by two, across the bridge. Soon the whole bridge was trembling and resounding.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	The clouds were drifting above him silently and silently the seatangle was drifting below him and the grey warm air was still and a new wild life was singing in his veins.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	A little wave of quiet mirth broke forth over the class of boys from the rector's grim smile.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	The vast cycle of starry life bore his weary mind outward to its verge and inward to its centre, a distant music accompanying him outward and inward.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	As he sat in his bench gazing calmly at the rector's shrewd harsh face, his mind wound itself in and out of the curious questions proposed to it.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	He is said to have baptized as many as ten thousand idolaters in one month.
M1/reference_wav/M1_ref.wav	He ceased to shake his clasped hands and, resting them against his forehead, looked right and left of them keenly at his listeners out of his dark stern eyes.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	Put them away quick before Andella and Rosalie see them.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	If Delia had attempted to give precisely the same lecture to the children themselves, they would very soon have become restless and uneasy, and it would have made very little impression upon them.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	"Well, but now?" said the Princess; and she filled his pockets with cakes, and put her own heavy gold chain around his neck, and bent down and kissed him.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	"But surely you would like to change caps with me," said the King, and raised his large, heavy gold crown from his head.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	Besides, a scolding would have made them unhappy, and this did not make them unhappy at all; it amused and entertained them.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	And his mother took him up in her lap, and he told her all his adventures, and how everybody wanted his cap.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	"Mary, your father and I are going out to ride this afternoon, and I am going to explain it all to you why you can not go too.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	So saying, she led the way on tiptoe, followed by the children out of the room, and round by a circuitous route to the piazza.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	But he had his cap. He still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	Once upon a time there was a little boy, called Anders, who had a new cap.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	The pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away, but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	For, like as not, they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	The Princess certainly was beautiful, and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her, but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	You love mamma, I am sure, and wish to have her get well soon. So you will be a good girl, I know, and not make any trouble, but will stay at home contentedly-won't you?
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	But just at this instant the Princess came tripping across the yard. She was dressed in white silk with bows of ribbon.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	He darted like an arrow through all the halls, down all the stairs, and across the yard.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	You will have a very pleasant time, I am sure; because you never quarrel.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	Such persons may be interested in the manner in which Delia made use of the children's dolls as a means of guiding and governing their little mothers.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	They are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	He twisted himself like an eel between the outstretched arms of the courtiers, and over the soldiers' muskets he jumped like a little rabbit.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	To such persons, these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will, or rather of yielding to their influence, are specially useful.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	He put his hands in his trousers pockets and went out for a walk, for he did not begrudge anybody's seeing how fine he was.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	"How do you do, my children?" she said, on one such occasion.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	But when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a King's golden crown, he said that Anders was a stupid.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	There are three different modes of management customarily employed by parents as means of inducing their children to comply with their requirements.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	On huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes, and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	So the children went to work with great alacrity, and put the playthings all away.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	I observe that, when you both wish for the same thing, you don't quarrel for it and try to pull it away from one another; but one waits like a lady until the other has done with it.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	But when one has a fine red cap with a blue tassel, one is too fine to ride on peat loads, and Anders trotted proudly by.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	And all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	To suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that, is entirely to mistake its nature and design.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	Now Delia contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	You have come, Andella (Andella was the name of Jane's doll), to make Rosalie a visit.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	"Dear me," he said, "if I did not think it was the gracious little count himself." And then he invited Anders to ride on the peat load.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	Nothing more was necessary except to shake up the mixture in order to facilitate the process of solution, and the medicine was ready.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	"Oh," she said, "he has such an extraordinarily fine cap on his head, that that will do just as well as a uniform."
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	"I am going to the court ball," answered Anders.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	"Indeed you are not," said the other soldier, and put his foot forward.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	"And it is made of mother's best yarn, and she knitted it herself, and everybody wants to get it away from me."
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	And a prettier cap you never could see, for mother herself had knitted it, and nobody could make anything quite as nice as mother could.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	"I can not tell you why, now," replies the mother, "but perhaps I will explain it to you after I come home.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	And then he said good bye to Lars with a nod; but Lars only made faces at him, for he was very much put out because he could not cheat Anders out of his cap which his mother had made.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	There is a secret-something I would not have them know on any account.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	"Well, well, give it to me," said the Princess, "and I will give you a kiss."
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	But the influences secured by these means form, at the best, but a sandy foundation for filial obedience to rest upon.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	When she became aware of Anders and the soldiers, she walked over to them.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	They were now playing with their dolls in the parlor.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	"If you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe, you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap."
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	Now this knife was a splendid one, though half the blade was gone, and the handle was a little cracked; and Anders knew that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jack knife.
M2/reference_wav/M2_ref.wav	A child, even, who has become once accustomed to them, will soon drop them if she finds, owing to a change in the system of management, that they now never succeed.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	Monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	"There cannot be a doubt he received you kindly, for, in fact, you returned without his permission."
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	"Pray do not leave me," said De Guiche, stretching out his hand towards her, "for you would be contradicting the kind words you have just pronounced.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	"Louise possesses every virtue, and has not a single fault." And the two young men passed on, and, as they proceeded, their voices were soon lost in the distance.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	"Oh! mademoiselle, why have I not a devoted sister, or a true friend, such as yourself?"
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	Remain, I implore you: the evening is most lovely.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	The king smiled upon De Guiche, who did not comprehend a word of Madame's dumb language, but he remarked that she pretended not to look at him, and he attributed the pardon which had been conferred upon him to the princess's kindness of heart.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	At this moment, a man, concealed in a dry ditch planted with young willow saplings, scrambled quickly up its shelving side, and ran off in the direction of the chateau.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	"Forgive me, I hardly know what I am saying; a thousand times forgive me; Madame was right, quite right, this brutal exile has completely turned my brain."
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	A cold shiver passed through poor De Guiche; he was unprepared for such utter indifference, for he had neither seen nor been told of anything that had taken place, and consequently could guess nothing.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	Near the songster, in the dark background of the large trees, could be seen the glistening eyes of an owl, attracted by the harmony.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	By degrees, as the sight became accustomed to so much brilliancy, the rarest beauties appeared to the view, as in the evening sky the stars appear one by one to him who closes his eyes and then opens them again.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	The ditches were bordered by high hedges full of flowers, which on that side protected the foot passengers from being intruded upon by the horses and carriages.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	De Guiche, observing that she was alone, near a thicket constructed of painted cloth, approached her.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	The queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent dias or platform, erected upon the borders of the lake, in a theater of wonderful elegance of construction.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	I am speaking seriously," replied Montalais, "and my opinion in this case is quite as good as the king's, I suppose; is it not, Louise?"
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	"Here?" replied the king, frowning, "here?
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	Her look had said to him: "Since they are jealous of you, divide their suspicions, for the man who distrusts two rivals does not object to either in particular." So that Madame, by this clever diversion, decided him.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	Every word fell distinctly, in perfect harmony and eloquence, upon Louis the fourteenth's ears.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	Disdainful of a success of which Madame showed no acknowledgement, he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the marked preference of the princess.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	As for the ballet itself, every person knew the part he had to take in it, and how to perform it.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	When she perceived the young man, she rose, like a woman surprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous of concealing from herself.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	Their flattery pleased, as much as De Guiche's courage had astonished him, and he simply replied: "I did not tell you to return, comte."
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	As for ourselves, we shall soon reach some retired spot where no eyes can see us and no step follow ours.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	"In my thoughts, monsieur, everything has changed."
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	The Elements, subaltern powers of mythology, together with their attributes, hastened to follow their gracious sovereign.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	The king remained for a moment to enjoy a triumph as complete as it could possibly be.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	She saw, but did not look at De Guiche, who, irritated and revengeful, turned his back upon her as she passed him, escorted by her nymphs, and followed by a hundred flatterers.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	As De Guiche quitted the theater for the purpose of getting into the fresh air he so much needed, he passed close to this figure and saluted her.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	"And yet it seemed to me that the king received you with kindness."
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	Beneath this oak the gardeners had piled up the moss and turf in such a manner that never had a seat more luxuriously rested the wearied limbs of man or monarch.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	Well, I can understand it; all women who are possessed of any feeling do, and one never finds them dull or lonely when removed from the giddy vortex of these exciting amusements.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	"I am a woman; and there are few like me; whoever loves me, flatters me; whoever flatters me, pleases me; and whoever pleases-"
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	Suddenly, for the purpose of restoring peace and order, Spring, accompanied by his whole court, made his appearance.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	The king, who had from this moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quadrille, cast a look upon his vanquished rival.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	"Good gracious! has the king any right to interfere in matters of that kind?
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	"So much the better," said Athenais, "because I see the torches setting out from the chateau and the theater, and they seem as if they were preceding some person of distinction."
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	He was dressed in a tunic of flowers, which set off his graceful and well formed figure to advantage.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	The arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	You wish to escape from the merry tumult, and prefer your own society.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	She, however, did not bestow a single glance upon him.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	"Then, I perceive," said Colbert, trembling with anger and fear, "that I have had the misfortune to fall into disgrace with your majesty."
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	The young girls had, indeed, made themselves small-indeed invisible.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	"And," added Louis, "as it seems a difficult matter for you, notwithstanding your economy, to defray, with so limited a sum, the expenses which I intend to incur, I will at once sign an order for three millions."
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	Look yonder, do you not see the moon slowly rising, silvering the topmost branches of the chestnuts and the oaks.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	"And yet," he said, "your majesty did not use this language some time ago, when the news about Belle Isle arrived, for instance."
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	Besides, the king's heart was filled with two or three new ideas; he had just derived fresh inspiration from the eloquent glances of Madame.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	The applause continued so long that the comte had ample leisure to join the king.
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	"Not at all; you are, on the contrary, most agreeable to me."
M3/reference_wav/M3_ref.wav	The two young men approached still closer, conversing in animated tones. "She was here just now," said the count.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	Yankee ingenuity had invented a new kind of breech loading gun called "Sharps rifle." It was, in fact, the best weapon of its day.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	On one point especially the Border Ruffians had a wholesome dread.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	"But," he added with a significant oath, "boys, we will fight some time!" Thirteen of the captains in the Wakarusa camp were called together, and the situation was duly explained.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	The murderer, a pro slavery man, first fled, to Missouri, but returned to Shawnee Mission and sought the official protection of Sheriff Jones; no warrant, no examination, no commitment followed, and the criminal remained at large.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	Opportunely for them, about this time Governor Shannon, appointed to succeed Reeder, arrived in the Territory.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	They consented to a compromise "to cover a retreat."
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	He continued his pretended search and, to give color to his errand, made two arrests.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	Of the lynchings, the mobs, and the murders, it would be impossible, except in a very extended work, to note the frequent and atrocious details.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	The forces of the Lecompton camp fully understand the plot and will fight under the same banner."
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	Half an hour later, turning a deaf ear to all remonstrance, he gave the proprietors until five o'clock to remove their families and personal property from the Free State Hotel.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	Meanwhile a sober second thought had come to Governor Shannon.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	The general public interest in the controversy was shown by discussions carried on by press, pulpit, and in the daily conversation and comment of the people of the Union in every town, hamlet, and neighborhood.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	They might be deaf to the "equalities" proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence or blind to the moral sin of slavery, but they comprehended a rifle which could be fired ten times a minute and kill a man at a thousand yards.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	With the advantage of its defensive position, Lawrence was as strong as the sheriff's mob.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	He ordered the forces to disband; prisoners were liberated, and with the opportune aid of a furious rain storm the Border Ruffian army gradually melted away.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	Organized and sustained in the beginning by voluntary contributions from that and distant States, they ended by levying forced contributions, by "pressing" horses, food, or arms from any neighborhood they chanced to visit.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	President Pierce, in his special message of january twenty fourth, declared what had been done by the Topeka movement to be "of a revolutionary character" which would "become treasonable insurrection if it reach the length of organized resistance."
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	Little by little, however, the latter became hemmed and bound in the meshes of the various devices and proceedings which the territorial officials evolved from the bogus laws.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	The Governor was denounced as a traitor, and Sheriff Jones declared that "he would have wiped out Lawrence." Atchison, on the contrary, sustained the bargain, explaining that to attack Lawrence under the circumstances would ruin the Democratic cause.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	His reception speech at Westport, in which he maintained the legality of the Legislature, and his determination to enforce their laws, delighted his pro slavery auditors.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	"We may have said that we would assist any proper officer in the service of any legal process," they replied, standing upon their interpretation.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	But the affair was magnified as a crowning proof that the free State men were insurrectionists and outlaws.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	Governor Robinson and Colonel Lane were appointed to command.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	In a few days an officer came with a requisition from Governor Shannon, and took the prisoner by land to Westport, and afterwards from there to Kansas City and Leavenworth.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	One of his militia generals suggested that the Governor should require the "outlaws at Lawrence and elsewhere" to surrender the Sharps rifles; another wrote asking him to call out the Government troops at Fort Leavenworth.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	The free State men shrank from forcible resistance to even bogus laws.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	Atchison, who had been haranguing the mob, planted his two guns before the building and trained them upon it.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	In this incident, contrasting the creative and the destructive spirit of the factions, the Emigrant Aid Society of Massachusetts finds its most honorable and triumphant vindication.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	With such a radical opposition of sentiment, both factions were on the alert to seize every available vantage ground.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	They could see that a conflict meant serious results.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	Burning with the thirst of personal revenge, Sheriff Jones now accused the town of Lawrence of the violation of law involved in this rescue, though the people of Lawrence immediately and earnestly disavowed the act.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	He hastened to Lawrence, which now invoked his protection.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	This was, of course, the original controversy-slavery burning to enforce her usurpation, freedom determined to defend her birthright.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	From these, again, sprang barricaded and fortified dwellings, camps and scouting parties, finally culminating in roving guerrilla bands, half partisan, half predatory.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	This was at the March election, eighteen fifty five.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	They next made application to the marshal, who tauntingly replied that he could not rely on their pledges, and must take the liberty to execute his process in his own time and manner.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	During and after the contest over the speakership at Washington, each State Legislature became a forum of Kansas debate.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	To embarrass this damaging exposure, Judge Lecompte issued a writ against the ex Governor on a frivolous charge of contempt.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	Two abortive imitations of the Missouri Blue Lodges, set on foot during the summer by the free State men, provoked by the election invasion in March, furnished them a starting point for military organization.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	Faithful to their legislative declaration they knew but one issue, slavery.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	The truce patched up by this Lawrence treaty was of comparatively short duration.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	The irregular Border Ruffian squads were hastily incorporated into the skeleton "Kansas militia." The "posse" became some two thousand strong, and the defenders of Lawrence perhaps one thousand.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	No posse was summoned, no further effort made, and Reeder, fearing personal violence, soon fled in disguise.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	The United States Arsenal at Liberty, Missouri, was broken into and stripped of its contents to supply cannon, small arms, and ammunition.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	A propitious moment for carrying it out seemed now to have arrived.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	The people of Lawrence denounced the deed; but the sheriff hoarded up the score for future revenge.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	Their assumed character changed with their changing opportunities or necessities.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	The bogus Legislature numbered thirty six members.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	The free State men clung to their prairie towns and prairie ravines with all the obstinacy and courage of true defenders of their homes and firesides.
M4/reference_wav/M4_ref.wav	Neither party was willing to yield honestly nor ready to fight manfully.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	The pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away, but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	For, like as not, they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	The Princess certainly was beautiful, and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her, but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	You love mamma, I am sure, and wish to have her get well soon. So you will be a good girl, I know, and not make any trouble, but will stay at home contentedly-won't you?
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	But just at this instant the Princess came tripping across the yard. She was dressed in white silk with bows of ribbon.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	He darted like an arrow through all the halls, down all the stairs, and across the yard.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	You will have a very pleasant time, I am sure; because you never quarrel.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	Such persons may be interested in the manner in which Delia made use of the children's dolls as a means of guiding and governing their little mothers.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	They are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	He twisted himself like an eel between the outstretched arms of the courtiers, and over the soldiers' muskets he jumped like a little rabbit.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	To such persons, these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will, or rather of yielding to their influence, are specially useful.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	He put his hands in his trousers pockets and went out for a walk, for he did not begrudge anybody's seeing how fine he was.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	"How do you do, my children?" she said, on one such occasion.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	But when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a King's golden crown, he said that Anders was a stupid.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	There are three different modes of management customarily employed by parents as means of inducing their children to comply with their requirements.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	On huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes, and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	So the children went to work with great alacrity, and put the playthings all away.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	I observe that, when you both wish for the same thing, you don't quarrel for it and try to pull it away from one another; but one waits like a lady until the other has done with it.

VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	"I can't bear it!" and over went her head on the music rack.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	"So I hope," said mrs Whitney; "and father, I do believe they'll repay you; for I do think there's good blood there; these children have a look about them that shows them worthy to be trusted."
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	"Oh!" she cried, coming out of her rapture a little, and springing over to mr King with Phronsie still in her arms.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	"I can't play with you like a little boy any more," he said slowly.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	"I don't know," said Van, running over in his mind all the possible ways he could think of for entertaining anybody, "unless she'd like my new book of travels-or my velocipede," he added.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	"Do you like mr Linstrum?" Marie asked suddenly.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	When Emil reached the lower corner by the hedge, Marie was sitting under her white mulberry tree, the pailful of cherries beside her, looking off at the gentle, tireless swelling of the wheat.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	So, with a great many chucklings and shruggings when no one was by, he had departed after breakfast one day, simply saying he shouldn't be back to lunch.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	His yellow canvas leggings and khaki trousers were splashed to the knees.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/VirtualF0_ref.wav	The grain is so heavy that it bends toward the blade and cuts like velvet.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	The pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away, but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	For, like as not, they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	The Princess certainly was beautiful, and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her, but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition.

VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	So the children went to work with great alacrity, and put the playthings all away.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	I observe that, when you both wish for the same thing, you don't quarrel for it and try to pull it away from one another; but one waits like a lady until the other has done with it.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	But when one has a fine red cap with a blue tassel, one is too fine to ride on peat loads, and Anders trotted proudly by.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	And all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	To suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that, is entirely to mistake its nature and design.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	Now Delia contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	You have come, Andella (Andella was the name of Jane's doll), to make Rosalie a visit.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	"Dear me," he said, "if I did not think it was the gracious little count himself." And then he invited Anders to ride on the peat load.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	Nothing more was necessary except to shake up the mixture in order to facilitate the process of solution, and the medicine was ready.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	"Oh," she said, "he has such an extraordinarily fine cap on his head, that that will do just as well as a uniform."
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	"I am going to the court ball," answered Anders.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	"Indeed you are not," said the other soldier, and put his foot forward.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	"And it is made of mother's best yarn, and she knitted it herself, and everybody wants to get it away from me."
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	And a prettier cap you never could see, for mother herself had knitted it, and nobody could make anything quite as nice as mother could.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	"I can not tell you why, now," replies the mother, "but perhaps I will explain it to you after I come home.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	And then he said good bye to Lars with a nod; but Lars only made faces at him, for he was very much put out because he could not cheat Anders out of his cap which his mother had made.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	There is a secret-something I would not have them know on any account.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	"Well, well, give it to me," said the Princess, "and I will give you a kiss."
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	But the influences secured by these means form, at the best, but a sandy foundation for filial obedience to rest upon.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	When she became aware of Anders and the soldiers, she walked over to them.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	They were now playing with their dolls in the parlor.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	"If you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe, you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap."
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	Now this knife was a splendid one, though half the blade was gone, and the handle was a little cracked; and Anders knew that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jack knife.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	A child, even, who has become once accustomed to them, will soon drop them if she finds, owing to a change in the system of management, that they now never succeed.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	"I can't bear it!" and over went her head on the music rack.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	"So I hope," said mrs Whitney; "and father, I do believe they'll repay you; for I do think there's good blood there; these children have a look about them that shows them worthy to be trusted."
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	"Oh!" she cried, coming out of her rapture a little, and springing over to mr King with Phronsie still in her arms.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	"I can't play with you like a little boy any more," he said slowly.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	"I don't know," said Van, running over in his mind all the possible ways he could think of for entertaining anybody, "unless she'd like my new book of travels-or my velocipede," he added.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	"Do you like mr Linstrum?" Marie asked suddenly.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	When Emil reached the lower corner by the hedge, Marie was sitting under her white mulberry tree, the pailful of cherries beside her, looking off at the gentle, tireless swelling of the wheat.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	So, with a great many chucklings and shruggings when no one was by, he had departed after breakfast one day, simply saying he shouldn't be back to lunch.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	His yellow canvas leggings and khaki trousers were splashed to the knees.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/VirtualF1_ref.wav	The grain is so heavy that it bends toward the blade and cuts like velvet.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/VirtualF2_ref.wav	The pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away, but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/VirtualF2_ref.wav	For, like as not, they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/VirtualF2_ref.wav	The Princess certainly was beautiful, and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her, but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/VirtualF2_ref.wav	You love mamma, I am sure, and wish to have her get well soon. So you will be a good girl, I know, and not make any trouble, but will stay at home contentedly-won't you?
VirtualF2/reference_wav/VirtualF2_ref.wav	But just at this instant the Princess came tripping across the yard. She was dressed in white silk with bows of ribbon.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/VirtualF2_ref.wav	He darted like an arrow through all the halls, down all the stairs, and across the yard.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/VirtualF2_ref.wav	You will have a very pleasant time, I am sure; because you never quarrel.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/VirtualF2_ref.wav	Such persons may be interested in the manner in which Delia made use of the children's dolls as a means of guiding and governing their little mothers.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/VirtualF2_ref.wav	They are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/VirtualF2_ref.wav	He twisted himself like an eel between the outstretched arms of the courtiers, and over the soldiers' muskets he jumped like a little rabbit.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/VirtualF2_ref.wav	To such persons, these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will, or rather of yielding to their influence, are specially useful.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/VirtualF2_ref.wav	He put his hands in his trousers pockets and went out for a walk, for he did not begrudge anybody's seeing how fine he was.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/VirtualF2_ref.wav	"How do you do, my children?" she said, on one such occasion.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/VirtualF2_ref.wav	But when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a King's golden crown, he said that Anders was a stupid.

VirtualF4/reference_wav/VirtualF4_ref.wav	So, with a great many chucklings and shruggings when no one was by, he had departed after breakfast one day, simply saying he shouldn't be back to lunch.
VirtualF4/reference_wav/VirtualF4_ref.wav	His yellow canvas leggings and khaki trousers were splashed to the knees.
VirtualF4/reference_wav/VirtualF4_ref.wav	The grain is so heavy that it bends toward the blade and cuts like velvet.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	The pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away, but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	For, like as not, they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	The Princess certainly was beautiful, and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her, but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	You love mamma, I am sure, and wish to have her get well soon. So you will be a good girl, I know, and not make any trouble, but will stay at home contentedly-won't you?
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	But just at this instant the Princess came tripping across the yard. She was dressed in white silk with bows of ribbon.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	He darted like an arrow through all the halls, down all the stairs, and across the yard.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	You will have a very pleasant time, I am sure; because you never quarrel.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	Such persons may be interested in the manner in which Delia made use of the children's dolls as a means of guiding and governing their little mothers.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	They are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	He twisted himself like an eel between the outstretched arms of the courtiers, and over the soldiers' muskets he jumped like a little rabbit.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	To such persons, these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will, or rather of yielding to their influence, are specially useful.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	He put his hands in his trousers pockets and went out for a walk, for he did not begrudge anybody's seeing how fine he was.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	"How do you do, my children?" she said, on one such occasion.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	But when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a King's golden crown, he said that Anders was a stupid.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	There are three different modes of management customarily employed by parents as means of inducing their children to comply with their requirements.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	On huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes, and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	So the children went to work with great alacrity, and put the playthings all away.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	I observe that, when you both wish for the same thing, you don't quarrel for it and try to pull it away from one another; but one waits like a lady until the other has done with it.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	But when one has a fine red cap with a blue tassel, one is too fine to ride on peat loads, and Anders trotted proudly by.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	And all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	To suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that, is entirely to mistake its nature and design.

VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	You have come, Andella (Andella was the name of Jane's doll), to make Rosalie a visit.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	"Dear me," he said, "if I did not think it was the gracious little count himself." And then he invited Anders to ride on the peat load.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	Nothing more was necessary except to shake up the mixture in order to facilitate the process of solution, and the medicine was ready.

VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	"And it is made of mother's best yarn, and she knitted it herself, and everybody wants to get it away from me."
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	And a prettier cap you never could see, for mother herself had knitted it, and nobody could make anything quite as nice as mother could.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	"I can not tell you why, now," replies the mother, "but perhaps I will explain it to you after I come home.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	And then he said good bye to Lars with a nod; but Lars only made faces at him, for he was very much put out because he could not cheat Anders out of his cap which his mother had made.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	There is a secret-something I would not have them know on any account.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	"Well, well, give it to me," said the Princess, "and I will give you a kiss."
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	But the influences secured by these means form, at the best, but a sandy foundation for filial obedience to rest upon.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	When she became aware of Anders and the soldiers, she walked over to them.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	They were now playing with their dolls in the parlor.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	"If you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe, you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap."
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	Now this knife was a splendid one, though half the blade was gone, and the handle was a little cracked; and Anders knew that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jack knife.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	A child, even, who has become once accustomed to them, will soon drop them if she finds, owing to a change in the system of management, that they now never succeed.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	"I can't bear it!" and over went her head on the music rack.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	"So I hope," said mrs Whitney; "and father, I do believe they'll repay you; for I do think there's good blood there; these children have a look about them that shows them worthy to be trusted."
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	"Oh!" she cried, coming out of her rapture a little, and springing over to mr King with Phronsie still in her arms.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	"I can't play with you like a little boy any more," he said slowly.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/VirtualM0_ref.wav	"I don't know," said Van, running over in his mind all the possible ways he could think of for entertaining anybody, "unless she'd like my new book of travels-or my velocipede," he added.

VirtualM3/reference_wav/VirtualM3_ref.wav	And a prettier cap you never could see, for mother herself had knitted it, and nobody could make anything quite as nice as mother could.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/VirtualM3_ref.wav	"I can not tell you why, now," replies the mother, "but perhaps I will explain it to you after I come home.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/VirtualM3_ref.wav	And then he said good bye to Lars with a nod; but Lars only made faces at him, for he was very much put out because he could not cheat Anders out of his cap which his mother had made.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/VirtualM3_ref.wav	There is a secret-something I would not have them know on any account.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/VirtualM3_ref.wav	"Well, well, give it to me," said the Princess, "and I will give you a kiss."
VirtualM3/reference_wav/VirtualM3_ref.wav	But the influences secured by these means form, at the best, but a sandy foundation for filial obedience to rest upon.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/VirtualM3_ref.wav	When she became aware of Anders and the soldiers, she walked over to them.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/VirtualM3_ref.wav	They were now playing with their dolls in the parlor.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/VirtualM3_ref.wav	"If you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe, you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap."
VirtualM3/reference_wav/VirtualM3_ref.wav	Now this knife was a splendid one, though half the blade was gone, and the handle was a little cracked; and Anders knew that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jack knife.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/VirtualM3_ref.wav	A child, even, who has become once accustomed to them, will soon drop them if she finds, owing to a change in the system of management, that they now never succeed.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/VirtualM3_ref.wav	"I can't bear it!" and over went her head on the music rack.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/VirtualM3_ref.wav	"So I hope," said mrs Whitney; "and father, I do believe they'll repay you; for I do think there's good blood there; these children have a look about them that shows them worthy to be trusted."
VirtualM3/reference_wav/VirtualM3_ref.wav	"Oh!" she cried, coming out of her rapture a little, and springing over to mr King with Phronsie still in her arms.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/VirtualM3_ref.wav	"I can't play with you like a little boy any more," he said slowly.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/VirtualM3_ref.wav	"I don't know," said Van, running over in his mind all the possible ways he could think of for entertaining anybody, "unless she'd like my new book of travels-or my velocipede," he added.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/VirtualM3_ref.wav	"Do you like mr Linstrum?" Marie asked suddenly.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/VirtualM3_ref.wav	When Emil reached the lower corner by the hedge, Marie was sitting under her white mulberry tree, the pailful of cherries beside her, looking off at the gentle, tireless swelling of the wheat.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/VirtualM3_ref.wav	So, with a great many chucklings and shruggings when no one was by, he had departed after breakfast one day, simply saying he shouldn't be back to lunch.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/VirtualM3_ref.wav	His yellow canvas leggings and khaki trousers were splashed to the knees.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/VirtualM3_ref.wav	The grain is so heavy that it bends toward the blade and cuts like velvet.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	The pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away, but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	For, like as not, they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	The Princess certainly was beautiful, and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her, but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	You love mamma, I am sure, and wish to have her get well soon. So you will be a good girl, I know, and not make any trouble, but will stay at home contentedly-won't you?
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	But just at this instant the Princess came tripping across the yard. She was dressed in white silk with bows of ribbon.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	He darted like an arrow through all the halls, down all the stairs, and across the yard.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	You will have a very pleasant time, I am sure; because you never quarrel.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	Such persons may be interested in the manner in which Delia made use of the children's dolls as a means of guiding and governing their little mothers.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	They are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	He twisted himself like an eel between the outstretched arms of the courtiers, and over the soldiers' muskets he jumped like a little rabbit.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	To such persons, these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will, or rather of yielding to their influence, are specially useful.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	He put his hands in his trousers pockets and went out for a walk, for he did not begrudge anybody's seeing how fine he was.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	"How do you do, my children?" she said, on one such occasion.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	But when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a King's golden crown, he said that Anders was a stupid.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	There are three different modes of management customarily employed by parents as means of inducing their children to comply with their requirements.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	On huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes, and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	So the children went to work with great alacrity, and put the playthings all away.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	I observe that, when you both wish for the same thing, you don't quarrel for it and try to pull it away from one another; but one waits like a lady until the other has done with it.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	But when one has a fine red cap with a blue tassel, one is too fine to ride on peat loads, and Anders trotted proudly by.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	And all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	To suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that, is entirely to mistake its nature and design.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	Now Delia contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	You have come, Andella (Andella was the name of Jane's doll), to make Rosalie a visit.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	"Dear me," he said, "if I did not think it was the gracious little count himself." And then he invited Anders to ride on the peat load.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	Nothing more was necessary except to shake up the mixture in order to facilitate the process of solution, and the medicine was ready.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	"Oh," she said, "he has such an extraordinarily fine cap on his head, that that will do just as well as a uniform."
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	"I am going to the court ball," answered Anders.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	"Indeed you are not," said the other soldier, and put his foot forward.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	"And it is made of mother's best yarn, and she knitted it herself, and everybody wants to get it away from me."
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	And a prettier cap you never could see, for mother herself had knitted it, and nobody could make anything quite as nice as mother could.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	"I can not tell you why, now," replies the mother, "but perhaps I will explain it to you after I come home.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	And then he said good bye to Lars with a nod; but Lars only made faces at him, for he was very much put out because he could not cheat Anders out of his cap which his mother had made.

VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	"I don't know," said Van, running over in his mind all the possible ways he could think of for entertaining anybody, "unless she'd like my new book of travels-or my velocipede," he added.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/VirtualM4_ref.wav	"Do you like mr Linstrum?" Marie asked suddenly.
