VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	"It is an observable fact," says Romanes,
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	He was a corn merchant who operated largely in grain.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	I was pretty sure it was the same man I saw. When they made him turn sideways, I was positive that was the one I seen, end quote.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	The assistant to the Director of the FBI testified that
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	The Secret Service's liaison with the agencies that supply information to it has been too casual.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	When lying under sentence of death in Newgate, he was visited by a lady, a gentlewoman in every sense of the word, who was said to be his sister.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	He replied that he was Zopyrus, and deserted to them from the Persians.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	it didn't do his case any good, end quote.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Palmer, alive to the danger he ran of a prosecution for forgery, should the fraud he had committed be brought to light,
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	It seems incredible that this passbook, which when produced in court
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	This was partly due to the survival of the old notion that the scene of the crime ought also to witness the retribution;
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	The authority of these wardsmen so improperly exalted, and so entirely unchecked, degenerated into a baneful despotism.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	that the committee of eighteen sixty-three fully endorsed Sir Joshua's recommendations as regards a "hard bed," and recommended that
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	the Prince too rose to shield her with his person. Again, providentially, the bullet went wide of the mark,
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	between the small producer, the small trader, the consumer,
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Mrs. A. C. Johnson, his landlady, testified that Oswald's room at ten twenty-six North Beckley Avenue
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	As McDonald fell into the seat with his left hand on the gun, he felt something graze across his hand and heard what sounded like the snap of the hammer.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	This reply of his contained no promise of immediate release.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	As President Kennedy and Governor Connally were being removed from the limousine onto stretchers,
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	as to whether Oswald fell within the category of, quote, threats against the President, end quote, which should be referred to the Service.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	The admissions made to Marina Oswald by her husband are an important element in the evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shot at General Walker.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Assistant Chief Batchelor of the Dallas police noted the absence of any formal statement by the Secret Service of specific work assigned to the police
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	so that crowds can get a good view of President Kennedy and his wife.

VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	He then chose out near three thousand of the leading citizens and caused them to be crucified, while he allowed the remainder still to inhabit the city.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	and noted that Oswald's verbal and clerical potential was, quote, outstanding, end quote.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	and as he was to some extent when he returned to the United States.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	four point eight to five point six seconds if the second shot missed,
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	On November twenty a front page story reported that the streets on which the Presidential motorcade would travel included "Main and Stemmons Freeway."
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	no additional place would be created.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	to notify the Secret Service of the substantial information about Lee Harvey Oswald which the FBI had accumulated
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	It was from Oswald's right hand, in which he carried the long package as he walked from Frazier's car to the building.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	because the president of the photographic firm for which he had previously worked
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Read the introduction to any of his inscriptions, of which the following is one, and you will call him vain and proud,
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	but when the two groups are traced downward they are found gradually to merge,

VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	This Commission can recommend no procedures for the future protection of our Presidents which will guarantee security.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	As a blind for their new frauds, they set up as law-stationers in York Buildings, Adelphi, and at once commenced their nefarious traffic.

VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	He subsequently found a job with the Texas School Book Depository for which he performed his duties satisfactorily.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	The blow fell suddenly, and when least expected. One morning Mr. Fasson asked casually for certain certificates,
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Articles, editorials, and letters to the editor in the Dallas Morning News and the Dallas Times-Herald after September thirteen
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Robert I. Bouck, special agent in charge of PRS,

VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Tippit stopped the man and called him to his car.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	He then arrived on Thursday, November twenty-one, nineteen sixty-three, end quote.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Another argument was, that it afforded more hope of the reformation of criminals.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	this was because of a defect in the scope which was recognized by the FBI agents and which they could have compensated for if they were aiming to hit a bull's-eye.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	The inmates, who euphemistically styled themselves "collegians,"
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	in the then existing state of the law,

VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Wilson was duly sentenced to death, and suffered impenitent, hardened, and without any confession of her guilt.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	The Strahan of the firm which came to grief was a Snow who changed his name for a fortune of two hundred thousand pounds;

VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	The regular daily visitation of the chaplain was also insisted upon.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	The route of the taxicab was retraced under the direction of Whaley.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	The instability of their relations was probably a function of the personalities of both people. Oswald was overbearing in relations with his wife.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	All these evils were set forth at length in the inspectors' first report.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Such excellent returns might be counted upon, that a margin of profit would be left after the cost of the prisons had been defrayed.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Oswald's defection was also the occasion for the opening of files by the Department of State, CIA, and the Office of Naval Intelligence.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	testified that Commission Exhibit Number one sixty-two was the jacket worn by the man they saw on November twenty-two.

VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	in the balance some work was done, but with the most meager results.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Stombaugh testified that the colors, shades, and twist of the fibers found in the tuft on the rifle matched those in Oswald's shirt.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	He crept along the coast close in shore, looking for a quiet spot to cast away the ship,
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	the security processing of gifts sent to the President, and technical inspections against covert listening devices.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Soak fist in cold water to numb the pain. Then slash my left wrist. Than plunge wrist into bathtub of hot water.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Now, as all books not primarily intended as picture-books consist principally of types composed to form letterpress,
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Feel free to criticize. Tell me of instances where work can be done better, or where improper practices prevail.

VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	No soldiers either.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Treatment of President Kennedy
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	His nature must have been kindly.

VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	the FBI instructions did not reflect fully the Secret Service's need for information regarding potential threats.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	heard police sirens and then saw a man as he, quote, ducked into, end quote, the outer lobby space of the theatre near the ticket office.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Nine of the latter were captured, with all the war material, cutlasses, pistols, hand-grenades, and ammunition.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	These were either satisfied with a makeshift, and modified existing buildings, without close regard to their suitability, or for a long time did nothing at all.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Mr. Gee at first stoutly refused.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	He was in bed with his breeches on (in the pockets of which were found a number of cartridges), the black belt he had worn at Cato Street,

VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	fairly electrified the court by declaring it his opinion that many deaths, supposed to be from cholera, were really due to poison.

VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	PRS attempts to eliminate serious risks by hospitalization or, where necessary,
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	In one interview, he told Fritz that the only sack he carried to work that day
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Despite these matches, however, Stombaugh was unable to render on opinion that the fibers which he found in the bag had probably come from the blanket,
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	It was not a standard type bag which could be obtained in a store and it was presumably made for a particular purpose.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	On Tarpey's defense it was stated that the idea of the theft had been suggested to him by a novel, at a time he had lost largely on the turf.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	and it is pretty certain that for some time he served both sides;
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	because she thought the FBI was in possession of a great deal of information and certainly would find it very easy to learn where Oswald was living.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	On the west end of the house is the attached garage, which can be reached from the kitchen or from the outside.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	which recommended restrictions upon the number of visitors admitted.

VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	This power is possessed by green plants alone; all other organisms being dependent for energy upon the potential energy of ready-made food.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	leading to an inequality, uncertainty, and inefficiency of punishment productive of the most prejudicial results.

VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	in which it was said I had enlarged upon the heinous nature of his crime, and warned the public to avoid such conduct.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	While Courvoisier opened the shutters, the housemaid, approaching the bed, saw that the pillow was saturated with blood.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	since there was limited, if any, opportunity for Oswald to handle the weapon during the two months prior to November twenty-two.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	She has subsequently admitted the existence of the conversation and offered an explanation for her denial.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	They were made to wash and swab the ward, or they were shut out from the ward fireplace, and forbidden to pass a chalked line drawn on the floor,
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Matters were rather better at the Marshalsea.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	But the testimony of these employees, together with photographs subsequently taken of them at the scene of the assassination,
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	The number of judges to be appointed would depend wholly on the decision of present judges now over seventy,

VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	The Commission could not accept important elements of Craig's testimony.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	and it stated that Mrs. Turner had been stricken with paralysis.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	As improvements are recommended for the advance detection of potential threats to the President, it could act as a final review board.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	As many various and, according to our ideas, heinous crimes came under this head,
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Inquiries were instituted when the cheque was protested, which led to the discovery of the forgeries.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	If any disturbance reached his ears, he reported the case to the governor, who next morning visited the ward in fault, and asked for the culprit.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	The station wagon stopped to pick up the man and then drove off.

VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	the arrangements relied upon by the Secret Service to perform this function were seriously deficient.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	After about a two-week separation, Marina Oswald returned to her husband.
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Mrs. Randle stated that on the morning of November twenty-two, while her brother was eating breakfast,
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	was followed in the very next year by those of Francis and of Bean in two consecutive months,
VirtualF0/reference_wav/sample_0.wav	Mrs. John F. Kennedy, on the left of the rear seat of the limousine, looked toward her left and waved to the crowds along the route.

VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	and that from the time of his conviction nothing but what is consolatory should be addressed to a criminal.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	Givens testified that after reaching the first floor, quote,
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	He drew up several long statements, containing narratives purely fictitious, imputing crimes to his victim, and repeating his line of defense
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	also bore impressions of the same irregularities that appeared on the barrel of the rifle.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	both in controlling his subordinates and in protecting the prisoners from petty tyranny and oppression, every one of whom he was to see once every twenty-four hours.

VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	to notify the Secret Service of the substantial information about Lee Harvey Oswald which the FBI had accumulated
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	It was from Oswald's right hand, in which he carried the long package as he walked from Frazier's car to the building.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	because the president of the photographic firm for which he had previously worked
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	Read the introduction to any of his inscriptions, of which the following is one, and you will call him vain and proud,
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	but when the two groups are traced downward they are found gradually to merge,

VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	This Commission can recommend no procedures for the future protection of our Presidents which will guarantee security.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	As a blind for their new frauds, they set up as law-stationers in York Buildings, Adelphi, and at once commenced their nefarious traffic.

VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	He subsequently found a job with the Texas School Book Depository for which he performed his duties satisfactorily.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	The blow fell suddenly, and when least expected. One morning Mr. Fasson asked casually for certain certificates,

VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	Robert I. Bouck, special agent in charge of PRS,

VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	He then arrived on Thursday, November twenty-one, nineteen sixty-three, end quote.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	Another argument was, that it afforded more hope of the reformation of criminals.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	this was because of a defect in the scope which was recognized by the FBI agents and which they could have compensated for if they were aiming to hit a bull's-eye.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	The inmates, who euphemistically styled themselves "collegians,"

VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	The regular daily visitation of the chaplain was also insisted upon.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	The route of the taxicab was retraced under the direction of Whaley.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	The instability of their relations was probably a function of the personalities of both people. Oswald was overbearing in relations with his wife.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	All these evils were set forth at length in the inspectors' first report.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	Such excellent returns might be counted upon, that a margin of profit would be left after the cost of the prisons had been defrayed.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	Oswald's defection was also the occasion for the opening of files by the Department of State, CIA, and the Office of Naval Intelligence.

VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	Stombaugh testified that the colors, shades, and twist of the fibers found in the tuft on the rifle matched those in Oswald's shirt.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	He crept along the coast close in shore, looking for a quiet spot to cast away the ship,

VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	Nine of the latter were captured, with all the war material, cutlasses, pistols, hand-grenades, and ammunition.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	These were either satisfied with a makeshift, and modified existing buildings, without close regard to their suitability, or for a long time did nothing at all.

VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	Despite these matches, however, Stombaugh was unable to render on opinion that the fibers which he found in the bag had probably come from the blanket,
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	It was not a standard type bag which could be obtained in a store and it was presumably made for a particular purpose.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	On Tarpey's defense it was stated that the idea of the theft had been suggested to him by a novel, at a time he had lost largely on the turf.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	and it is pretty certain that for some time he served both sides;
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	because she thought the FBI was in possession of a great deal of information and certainly would find it very easy to learn where Oswald was living.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	On the west end of the house is the attached garage, which can be reached from the kitchen or from the outside.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	which recommended restrictions upon the number of visitors admitted.

VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	This power is possessed by green plants alone; all other organisms being dependent for energy upon the potential energy of ready-made food.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	leading to an inequality, uncertainty, and inefficiency of punishment productive of the most prejudicial results.

VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	in which it was said I had enlarged upon the heinous nature of his crime, and warned the public to avoid such conduct.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	While Courvoisier opened the shutters, the housemaid, approaching the bed, saw that the pillow was saturated with blood.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	since there was limited, if any, opportunity for Oswald to handle the weapon during the two months prior to November twenty-two.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	She has subsequently admitted the existence of the conversation and offered an explanation for her denial.

VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	Matters were rather better at the Marshalsea.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	But the testimony of these employees, together with photographs subsequently taken of them at the scene of the assassination,
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	The number of judges to be appointed would depend wholly on the decision of present judges now over seventy,

VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	The Commission could not accept important elements of Craig's testimony.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	and it stated that Mrs. Turner had been stricken with paralysis.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	As improvements are recommended for the advance detection of potential threats to the President, it could act as a final review board.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	As many various and, according to our ideas, heinous crimes came under this head,
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	Inquiries were instituted when the cheque was protested, which led to the discovery of the forgeries.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	If any disturbance reached his ears, he reported the case to the governor, who next morning visited the ward in fault, and asked for the culprit.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	The station wagon stopped to pick up the man and then drove off.

VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	the arrangements relied upon by the Secret Service to perform this function were seriously deficient.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	After about a two-week separation, Marina Oswald returned to her husband.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	Mrs. Randle stated that on the morning of November twenty-two, while her brother was eating breakfast,
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	was followed in the very next year by those of Francis and of Bean in two consecutive months,
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	Mrs. John F. Kennedy, on the left of the rear seat of the limousine, looked toward her left and waved to the crowds along the route.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	Further sums were to have been paid after the escape;
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	of the criminal intent to kill.
VirtualF1/reference_wav/sample_60.wav	It was, however, proved that Howard was in needy circumstances, and that his proposals to Mr. Mullay could only have originated in a desire to rob him.

VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	and that from the time of his conviction nothing but what is consolatory should be addressed to a criminal.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	Givens testified that after reaching the first floor, quote,
VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	He drew up several long statements, containing narratives purely fictitious, imputing crimes to his victim, and repeating his line of defense
VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	also bore impressions of the same irregularities that appeared on the barrel of the rifle.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	both in controlling his subordinates and in protecting the prisoners from petty tyranny and oppression, every one of whom he was to see once every twenty-four hours.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	There among the ruins they still live in the same kind of houses,

VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	It happened that a lad named Bean had absconded from his father's home some weeks before,
VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	he passed other unimportant fortresses, and came at last to a walled enclosure, which the natives pointed out as a royal hunting ground.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	He indicated, however, that he would have to delay that program because of his immediate financial needs and responsibilities.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	Finally, on coming downstairs after bed-time, Lord William had found Courvoisier in the dining-room.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	He said it was in Japan that he made up his mind to go to Russia
VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	"It is an observable fact," says Romanes,

VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	The authority of these wardsmen so improperly exalted, and so entirely unchecked, degenerated into a baneful despotism.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	that the committee of eighteen sixty-three fully endorsed Sir Joshua's recommendations as regards a "hard bed," and recommended that
VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	the Prince too rose to shield her with his person. Again, providentially, the bullet went wide of the mark,
VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	between the small producer, the small trader, the consumer,
VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	Mrs. A. C. Johnson, his landlady, testified that Oswald's room at ten twenty-six North Beckley Avenue

VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	This reply of his contained no promise of immediate release.

VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	but when the two groups are traced downward they are found gradually to merge,

VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	The blow fell suddenly, and when least expected. One morning Mr. Fasson asked casually for certain certificates,

VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	Another argument was, that it afforded more hope of the reformation of criminals.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	this was because of a defect in the scope which was recognized by the FBI agents and which they could have compensated for if they were aiming to hit a bull's-eye.

VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	The route of the taxicab was retraced under the direction of Whaley.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	The instability of their relations was probably a function of the personalities of both people. Oswald was overbearing in relations with his wife.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	All these evils were set forth at length in the inspectors' first report.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	Such excellent returns might be counted upon, that a margin of profit would be left after the cost of the prisons had been defrayed.

VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	It was not a standard type bag which could be obtained in a store and it was presumably made for a particular purpose.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	On Tarpey's defense it was stated that the idea of the theft had been suggested to him by a novel, at a time he had lost largely on the turf.
VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	and it is pretty certain that for some time he served both sides;
VirtualF2/reference_wav/sample_120.wav	because she thought the FBI was in possession of a great deal of information and certainly would find it very easy to learn where Oswald was living.

VirtualF3/reference_wav/sample_180.wav	It happened that a lad named Bean had absconded from his father's home some weeks before,

VirtualF3/reference_wav/sample_180.wav	He indicated, however, that he would have to delay that program because of his immediate financial needs and responsibilities.
VirtualF3/reference_wav/sample_180.wav	Finally, on coming downstairs after bed-time, Lord William had found Courvoisier in the dining-room.

VirtualF3/reference_wav/sample_180.wav	that the committee of eighteen sixty-three fully endorsed Sir Joshua's recommendations as regards a "hard bed," and recommended that
VirtualF3/reference_wav/sample_180.wav	the Prince too rose to shield her with his person. Again, providentially, the bullet went wide of the mark,
VirtualF3/reference_wav/sample_180.wav	between the small producer, the small trader, the consumer,
VirtualF3/reference_wav/sample_180.wav	Mrs. A. C. Johnson, his landlady, testified that Oswald's room at ten twenty-six North Beckley Avenue
VirtualF3/reference_wav/sample_180.wav	As McDonald fell into the seat with his left hand on the gun, he felt something graze across his hand and heard what sounded like the snap of the hammer.

VirtualF3/reference_wav/sample_180.wav	It was from Oswald's right hand, in which he carried the long package as he walked from Frazier's car to the building.

VirtualF3/reference_wav/sample_180.wav	The instability of their relations was probably a function of the personalities of both people. Oswald was overbearing in relations with his wife.

VirtualF3/reference_wav/sample_180.wav	On Tarpey's defense it was stated that the idea of the theft had been suggested to him by a novel, at a time he had lost largely on the turf.
VirtualF3/reference_wav/sample_180.wav	and it is pretty certain that for some time he served both sides;

VirtualF4/reference_wav/sample_240.wav	The blow fell suddenly, and when least expected. One morning Mr. Fasson asked casually for certain certificates,

VirtualF4/reference_wav/sample_240.wav	On Tarpey's defense it was stated that the idea of the theft had been suggested to him by a novel, at a time he had lost largely on the turf.

VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	It happened that a lad named Bean had absconded from his father's home some weeks before,
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	he passed other unimportant fortresses, and came at last to a walled enclosure, which the natives pointed out as a royal hunting ground.

VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	that the committee of eighteen sixty-three fully endorsed Sir Joshua's recommendations as regards a "hard bed," and recommended that
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	the Prince too rose to shield her with his person. Again, providentially, the bullet went wide of the mark,

VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	He then chose out near three thousand of the leading citizens and caused them to be crucified, while he allowed the remainder still to inhabit the city.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	and noted that Oswald's verbal and clerical potential was, quote, outstanding, end quote.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	and as he was to some extent when he returned to the United States.

VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	On November twenty a front page story reported that the streets on which the Presidential motorcade would travel included "Main and Stemmons Freeway."
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	no additional place would be created.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	to notify the Secret Service of the substantial information about Lee Harvey Oswald which the FBI had accumulated
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	It was from Oswald's right hand, in which he carried the long package as he walked from Frazier's car to the building.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	because the president of the photographic firm for which he had previously worked
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	Read the introduction to any of his inscriptions, of which the following is one, and you will call him vain and proud,
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	but when the two groups are traced downward they are found gradually to merge,
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	were fired from the southeast corner window of the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	The state side was the part stolen from the female felons' side.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	This Commission can recommend no procedures for the future protection of our Presidents which will guarantee security.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	As a blind for their new frauds, they set up as law-stationers in York Buildings, Adelphi, and at once commenced their nefarious traffic.

VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	She is described as a well-made little woman, something more than thirty years of age, of a pale complexion and not disagreeable features.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	He subsequently found a job with the Texas School Book Depository for which he performed his duties satisfactorily.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	The blow fell suddenly, and when least expected. One morning Mr. Fasson asked casually for certain certificates,

VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	Robert I. Bouck, special agent in charge of PRS,

VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	Inquiry into the character of Good exposed him as a loose liver, who "kept company" with several women.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	having first set apart their mothers, each man chose besides out of his whole household one woman whomsoever he pleased;
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	Tippit stopped the man and called him to his car.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	He then arrived on Thursday, November twenty-one, nineteen sixty-three, end quote.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	Another argument was, that it afforded more hope of the reformation of criminals.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	this was because of a defect in the scope which was recognized by the FBI agents and which they could have compensated for if they were aiming to hit a bull's-eye.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	The inmates, who euphemistically styled themselves "collegians,"
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	in the then existing state of the law,

VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	The regular daily visitation of the chaplain was also insisted upon.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	The route of the taxicab was retraced under the direction of Whaley.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	The instability of their relations was probably a function of the personalities of both people. Oswald was overbearing in relations with his wife.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	All these evils were set forth at length in the inspectors' first report.

VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	Stombaugh testified that the colors, shades, and twist of the fibers found in the tuft on the rifle matched those in Oswald's shirt.

VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	His nature must have been kindly.

VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	heard police sirens and then saw a man as he, quote, ducked into, end quote, the outer lobby space of the theatre near the ticket office.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	Nine of the latter were captured, with all the war material, cutlasses, pistols, hand-grenades, and ammunition.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	These were either satisfied with a makeshift, and modified existing buildings, without close regard to their suitability, or for a long time did nothing at all.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	Mr. Gee at first stoutly refused.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	He was in bed with his breeches on (in the pockets of which were found a number of cartridges), the black belt he had worn at Cato Street,
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	"It is well known," likewise comments Le Conte,
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	While on a visit to Macclesfield he heard by chance of Miss Turner, and that she would inherit all her father's possessions.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	Marina Oswald testified that her husband engaged in Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities, quote,

VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	Despite these matches, however, Stombaugh was unable to render on opinion that the fibers which he found in the bag had probably come from the blanket,
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	It was not a standard type bag which could be obtained in a store and it was presumably made for a particular purpose.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	On Tarpey's defense it was stated that the idea of the theft had been suggested to him by a novel, at a time he had lost largely on the turf.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	and it is pretty certain that for some time he served both sides;
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	because she thought the FBI was in possession of a great deal of information and certainly would find it very easy to learn where Oswald was living.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	On the west end of the house is the attached garage, which can be reached from the kitchen or from the outside.

VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	While Courvoisier opened the shutters, the housemaid, approaching the bed, saw that the pillow was saturated with blood.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	since there was limited, if any, opportunity for Oswald to handle the weapon during the two months prior to November twenty-two.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	She has subsequently admitted the existence of the conversation and offered an explanation for her denial.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	They were made to wash and swab the ward, or they were shut out from the ward fireplace, and forbidden to pass a chalked line drawn on the floor,
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	Matters were rather better at the Marshalsea.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	But the testimony of these employees, together with photographs subsequently taken of them at the scene of the assassination,
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	The number of judges to be appointed would depend wholly on the decision of present judges now over seventy,

VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	The Commission could not accept important elements of Craig's testimony.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	and it stated that Mrs. Turner had been stricken with paralysis.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	As improvements are recommended for the advance detection of potential threats to the President, it could act as a final review board.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	As many various and, according to our ideas, heinous crimes came under this head,
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	Inquiries were instituted when the cheque was protested, which led to the discovery of the forgeries.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	If any disturbance reached his ears, he reported the case to the governor, who next morning visited the ward in fault, and asked for the culprit.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	The station wagon stopped to pick up the man and then drove off.

VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	the arrangements relied upon by the Secret Service to perform this function were seriously deficient.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	After about a two-week separation, Marina Oswald returned to her husband.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	Mrs. Randle stated that on the morning of November twenty-two, while her brother was eating breakfast,
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	was followed in the very next year by those of Francis and of Bean in two consecutive months,
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	Mrs. John F. Kennedy, on the left of the rear seat of the limousine, looked toward her left and waved to the crowds along the route.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	Further sums were to have been paid after the escape;
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	of the criminal intent to kill.
VirtualM0/reference_wav/sample_360.wav	It was, however, proved that Howard was in needy circumstances, and that his proposals to Mr. Mullay could only have originated in a desire to rob him.

VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	and that from the time of his conviction nothing but what is consolatory should be addressed to a criminal.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	Givens testified that after reaching the first floor, quote,
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	He drew up several long statements, containing narratives purely fictitious, imputing crimes to his victim, and repeating his line of defense
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	also bore impressions of the same irregularities that appeared on the barrel of the rifle.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	both in controlling his subordinates and in protecting the prisoners from petty tyranny and oppression, every one of whom he was to see once every twenty-four hours.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	There among the ruins they still live in the same kind of houses,
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	and that he was constantly engaged attending sessions and going with drafts to the hulks.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	England has her peculiarities and we have ours
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	This variety was often extended to all branches of prison economy.

VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	as one entitled to receive mail.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	It is the clear intention of our public policy to provide for a constant flow of new and younger blood into the judiciary.

VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	and Elder had to be assisted by two bank porters, who carried it for him to a carriage waiting near the Mansion House.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	It happened that a lad named Bean had absconded from his father's home some weeks before,
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	he passed other unimportant fortresses, and came at last to a walled enclosure, which the natives pointed out as a royal hunting ground.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	He indicated, however, that he would have to delay that program because of his immediate financial needs and responsibilities.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	Finally, on coming downstairs after bed-time, Lord William had found Courvoisier in the dining-room.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	He said it was in Japan that he made up his mind to go to Russia

VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	I was pretty sure it was the same man I saw. When they made him turn sideways, I was positive that was the one I seen, end quote.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	The assistant to the Director of the FBI testified that
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	The Secret Service's liaison with the agencies that supply information to it has been too casual.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	When lying under sentence of death in Newgate, he was visited by a lady, a gentlewoman in every sense of the word, who was said to be his sister.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	He replied that he was Zopyrus, and deserted to them from the Persians.

VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	Palmer, alive to the danger he ran of a prosecution for forgery, should the fraud he had committed be brought to light,
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	It seems incredible that this passbook, which when produced in court
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	This was partly due to the survival of the old notion that the scene of the crime ought also to witness the retribution;
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	The authority of these wardsmen so improperly exalted, and so entirely unchecked, degenerated into a baneful despotism.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	that the committee of eighteen sixty-three fully endorsed Sir Joshua's recommendations as regards a "hard bed," and recommended that
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	the Prince too rose to shield her with his person. Again, providentially, the bullet went wide of the mark,
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	between the small producer, the small trader, the consumer,
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	Mrs. A. C. Johnson, his landlady, testified that Oswald's room at ten twenty-six North Beckley Avenue
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	As McDonald fell into the seat with his left hand on the gun, he felt something graze across his hand and heard what sounded like the snap of the hammer.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	This reply of his contained no promise of immediate release.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	As President Kennedy and Governor Connally were being removed from the limousine onto stretchers,

VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	The admissions made to Marina Oswald by her husband are an important element in the evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shot at General Walker.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	Assistant Chief Batchelor of the Dallas police noted the absence of any formal statement by the Secret Service of specific work assigned to the police
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	so that crowds can get a good view of President Kennedy and his wife.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	For fifteen years Dr. Koldewey and his assistants, with a force of two hundred native workmen, have labored there winter and summer.

VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	continued during this period in New Orleans (nineteen fifty-four to nineteen fifty-six).
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	He then chose out near three thousand of the leading citizens and caused them to be crucified, while he allowed the remainder still to inhabit the city.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	and noted that Oswald's verbal and clerical potential was, quote, outstanding, end quote.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	and as he was to some extent when he returned to the United States.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	four point eight to five point six seconds if the second shot missed,
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	On November twenty a front page story reported that the streets on which the Presidential motorcade would travel included "Main and Stemmons Freeway."
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	no additional place would be created.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	to notify the Secret Service of the substantial information about Lee Harvey Oswald which the FBI had accumulated
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	It was from Oswald's right hand, in which he carried the long package as he walked from Frazier's car to the building.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	because the president of the photographic firm for which he had previously worked
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	Read the introduction to any of his inscriptions, of which the following is one, and you will call him vain and proud,
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	but when the two groups are traced downward they are found gradually to merge,
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	were fired from the southeast corner window of the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	The state side was the part stolen from the female felons' side.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	This Commission can recommend no procedures for the future protection of our Presidents which will guarantee security.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	As a blind for their new frauds, they set up as law-stationers in York Buildings, Adelphi, and at once commenced their nefarious traffic.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	who had poisoned his master and many of his dependents.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	She is described as a well-made little woman, something more than thirty years of age, of a pale complexion and not disagreeable features.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	He subsequently found a job with the Texas School Book Depository for which he performed his duties satisfactorily.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	The blow fell suddenly, and when least expected. One morning Mr. Fasson asked casually for certain certificates,
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	Articles, editorials, and letters to the editor in the Dallas Morning News and the Dallas Times-Herald after September thirteen
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	Robert I. Bouck, special agent in charge of PRS,
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	but there was no doubt of his guilt, as the Lord Chief Justice told him, while expressing great regret at his rash assertion.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	It had been purchased in March nineteen sixty-three, and taken to New Orleans where Marina Oswald saw it in their rented apartment
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	for the manufacture of starchy food from gaseous matter.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	Inquiry into the character of Good exposed him as a loose liver, who "kept company" with several women.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	having first set apart their mothers, each man chose besides out of his whole household one woman whomsoever he pleased;
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	Tippit stopped the man and called him to his car.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	He then arrived on Thursday, November twenty-one, nineteen sixty-three, end quote.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	Another argument was, that it afforded more hope of the reformation of criminals.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	this was because of a defect in the scope which was recognized by the FBI agents and which they could have compensated for if they were aiming to hit a bull's-eye.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	The inmates, who euphemistically styled themselves "collegians,"
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	in the then existing state of the law,
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	Immediately after the assassination, however,
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	As time passed, however, these magistrates made no effort at reform.

VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	Wilson was duly sentenced to death, and suffered impenitent, hardened, and without any confession of her guilt.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	The Strahan of the firm which came to grief was a Snow who changed his name for a fortune of two hundred thousand pounds;

VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	The regular daily visitation of the chaplain was also insisted upon.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	The route of the taxicab was retraced under the direction of Whaley.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	The instability of their relations was probably a function of the personalities of both people. Oswald was overbearing in relations with his wife.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	All these evils were set forth at length in the inspectors' first report.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	Such excellent returns might be counted upon, that a margin of profit would be left after the cost of the prisons had been defrayed.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	Oswald's defection was also the occasion for the opening of files by the Department of State, CIA, and the Office of Naval Intelligence.

VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	in the balance some work was done, but with the most meager results.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	Stombaugh testified that the colors, shades, and twist of the fibers found in the tuft on the rifle matched those in Oswald's shirt.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	He crept along the coast close in shore, looking for a quiet spot to cast away the ship,

VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	Despite these matches, however, Stombaugh was unable to render on opinion that the fibers which he found in the bag had probably come from the blanket,
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	It was not a standard type bag which could be obtained in a store and it was presumably made for a particular purpose.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	On Tarpey's defense it was stated that the idea of the theft had been suggested to him by a novel, at a time he had lost largely on the turf.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	and it is pretty certain that for some time he served both sides;
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	because she thought the FBI was in possession of a great deal of information and certainly would find it very easy to learn where Oswald was living.

VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	As many various and, according to our ideas, heinous crimes came under this head,
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	Inquiries were instituted when the cheque was protested, which led to the discovery of the forgeries.
VirtualM1/reference_wav/sample_420.wav	If any disturbance reached his ears, he reported the case to the governor, who next morning visited the ward in fault, and asked for the culprit.

VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	also bore impressions of the same irregularities that appeared on the barrel of the rifle.

VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	It happened that a lad named Bean had absconded from his father's home some weeks before,
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	he passed other unimportant fortresses, and came at last to a walled enclosure, which the natives pointed out as a royal hunting ground.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	He indicated, however, that he would have to delay that program because of his immediate financial needs and responsibilities.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	Finally, on coming downstairs after bed-time, Lord William had found Courvoisier in the dining-room.

VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	The assistant to the Director of the FBI testified that

VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	It seems incredible that this passbook, which when produced in court
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	This was partly due to the survival of the old notion that the scene of the crime ought also to witness the retribution;
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	The authority of these wardsmen so improperly exalted, and so entirely unchecked, degenerated into a baneful despotism.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	that the committee of eighteen sixty-three fully endorsed Sir Joshua's recommendations as regards a "hard bed," and recommended that
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	the Prince too rose to shield her with his person. Again, providentially, the bullet went wide of the mark,
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	between the small producer, the small trader, the consumer,
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	Mrs. A. C. Johnson, his landlady, testified that Oswald's room at ten twenty-six North Beckley Avenue
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	As McDonald fell into the seat with his left hand on the gun, he felt something graze across his hand and heard what sounded like the snap of the hammer.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	This reply of his contained no promise of immediate release.

VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	so that crowds can get a good view of President Kennedy and his wife.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	For fifteen years Dr. Koldewey and his assistants, with a force of two hundred native workmen, have labored there winter and summer.

VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	He then chose out near three thousand of the leading citizens and caused them to be crucified, while he allowed the remainder still to inhabit the city.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	and noted that Oswald's verbal and clerical potential was, quote, outstanding, end quote.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	and as he was to some extent when he returned to the United States.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	four point eight to five point six seconds if the second shot missed,
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	On November twenty a front page story reported that the streets on which the Presidential motorcade would travel included "Main and Stemmons Freeway."
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	no additional place would be created.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	to notify the Secret Service of the substantial information about Lee Harvey Oswald which the FBI had accumulated
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	It was from Oswald's right hand, in which he carried the long package as he walked from Frazier's car to the building.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	because the president of the photographic firm for which he had previously worked
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	Read the introduction to any of his inscriptions, of which the following is one, and you will call him vain and proud,
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	but when the two groups are traced downward they are found gradually to merge,
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	were fired from the southeast corner window of the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	The state side was the part stolen from the female felons' side.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	This Commission can recommend no procedures for the future protection of our Presidents which will guarantee security.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	As a blind for their new frauds, they set up as law-stationers in York Buildings, Adelphi, and at once commenced their nefarious traffic.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	who had poisoned his master and many of his dependents.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	She is described as a well-made little woman, something more than thirty years of age, of a pale complexion and not disagreeable features.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	He subsequently found a job with the Texas School Book Depository for which he performed his duties satisfactorily.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	The blow fell suddenly, and when least expected. One morning Mr. Fasson asked casually for certain certificates,
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	Articles, editorials, and letters to the editor in the Dallas Morning News and the Dallas Times-Herald after September thirteen
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	Robert I. Bouck, special agent in charge of PRS,

VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	for the manufacture of starchy food from gaseous matter.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	Inquiry into the character of Good exposed him as a loose liver, who "kept company" with several women.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	having first set apart their mothers, each man chose besides out of his whole household one woman whomsoever he pleased;
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	Tippit stopped the man and called him to his car.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	He then arrived on Thursday, November twenty-one, nineteen sixty-three, end quote.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	Another argument was, that it afforded more hope of the reformation of criminals.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	this was because of a defect in the scope which was recognized by the FBI agents and which they could have compensated for if they were aiming to hit a bull's-eye.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	The inmates, who euphemistically styled themselves "collegians,"
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	in the then existing state of the law,

VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	The regular daily visitation of the chaplain was also insisted upon.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	The route of the taxicab was retraced under the direction of Whaley.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	The instability of their relations was probably a function of the personalities of both people. Oswald was overbearing in relations with his wife.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	All these evils were set forth at length in the inspectors' first report.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	Such excellent returns might be counted upon, that a margin of profit would be left after the cost of the prisons had been defrayed.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	Oswald's defection was also the occasion for the opening of files by the Department of State, CIA, and the Office of Naval Intelligence.

VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	Stombaugh testified that the colors, shades, and twist of the fibers found in the tuft on the rifle matched those in Oswald's shirt.
VirtualM2/reference_wav/sample_480.wav	He crept along the coast close in shore, looking for a quiet spot to cast away the ship,

VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	It happened that a lad named Bean had absconded from his father's home some weeks before,
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	he passed other unimportant fortresses, and came at last to a walled enclosure, which the natives pointed out as a royal hunting ground.

VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	that the committee of eighteen sixty-three fully endorsed Sir Joshua's recommendations as regards a "hard bed," and recommended that
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	the Prince too rose to shield her with his person. Again, providentially, the bullet went wide of the mark,
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	between the small producer, the small trader, the consumer,
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	Mrs. A. C. Johnson, his landlady, testified that Oswald's room at ten twenty-six North Beckley Avenue
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	As McDonald fell into the seat with his left hand on the gun, he felt something graze across his hand and heard what sounded like the snap of the hammer.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	This reply of his contained no promise of immediate release.

VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	so that crowds can get a good view of President Kennedy and his wife.

VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	He then chose out near three thousand of the leading citizens and caused them to be crucified, while he allowed the remainder still to inhabit the city.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	and noted that Oswald's verbal and clerical potential was, quote, outstanding, end quote.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	and as he was to some extent when he returned to the United States.

VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	On November twenty a front page story reported that the streets on which the Presidential motorcade would travel included "Main and Stemmons Freeway."
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	no additional place would be created.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	to notify the Secret Service of the substantial information about Lee Harvey Oswald which the FBI had accumulated
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	It was from Oswald's right hand, in which he carried the long package as he walked from Frazier's car to the building.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	because the president of the photographic firm for which he had previously worked
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	Read the introduction to any of his inscriptions, of which the following is one, and you will call him vain and proud,
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	but when the two groups are traced downward they are found gradually to merge,
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	were fired from the southeast corner window of the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	The state side was the part stolen from the female felons' side.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	This Commission can recommend no procedures for the future protection of our Presidents which will guarantee security.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	As a blind for their new frauds, they set up as law-stationers in York Buildings, Adelphi, and at once commenced their nefarious traffic.

VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	She is described as a well-made little woman, something more than thirty years of age, of a pale complexion and not disagreeable features.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	He subsequently found a job with the Texas School Book Depository for which he performed his duties satisfactorily.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	The blow fell suddenly, and when least expected. One morning Mr. Fasson asked casually for certain certificates,

VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	Robert I. Bouck, special agent in charge of PRS,

VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	Inquiry into the character of Good exposed him as a loose liver, who "kept company" with several women.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	having first set apart their mothers, each man chose besides out of his whole household one woman whomsoever he pleased;
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	Tippit stopped the man and called him to his car.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	He then arrived on Thursday, November twenty-one, nineteen sixty-three, end quote.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	Another argument was, that it afforded more hope of the reformation of criminals.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	this was because of a defect in the scope which was recognized by the FBI agents and which they could have compensated for if they were aiming to hit a bull's-eye.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	The inmates, who euphemistically styled themselves "collegians,"
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	in the then existing state of the law,

VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	The regular daily visitation of the chaplain was also insisted upon.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	The route of the taxicab was retraced under the direction of Whaley.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	The instability of their relations was probably a function of the personalities of both people. Oswald was overbearing in relations with his wife.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	All these evils were set forth at length in the inspectors' first report.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	Such excellent returns might be counted upon, that a margin of profit would be left after the cost of the prisons had been defrayed.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	Oswald's defection was also the occasion for the opening of files by the Department of State, CIA, and the Office of Naval Intelligence.

VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	in the balance some work was done, but with the most meager results.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	Stombaugh testified that the colors, shades, and twist of the fibers found in the tuft on the rifle matched those in Oswald's shirt.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	He crept along the coast close in shore, looking for a quiet spot to cast away the ship,

VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	Nine of the latter were captured, with all the war material, cutlasses, pistols, hand-grenades, and ammunition.
VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	These were either satisfied with a makeshift, and modified existing buildings, without close regard to their suitability, or for a long time did nothing at all.

VirtualM3/reference_wav/sample_540.wav	Inquiries were instituted when the cheque was protested, which led to the discovery of the forgeries.

VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	It happened that a lad named Bean had absconded from his father's home some weeks before,
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	he passed other unimportant fortresses, and came at last to a walled enclosure, which the natives pointed out as a royal hunting ground.

VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	It seems incredible that this passbook, which when produced in court
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	This was partly due to the survival of the old notion that the scene of the crime ought also to witness the retribution;
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	The authority of these wardsmen so improperly exalted, and so entirely unchecked, degenerated into a baneful despotism.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	that the committee of eighteen sixty-three fully endorsed Sir Joshua's recommendations as regards a "hard bed," and recommended that
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	the Prince too rose to shield her with his person. Again, providentially, the bullet went wide of the mark,

VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	Mrs. A. C. Johnson, his landlady, testified that Oswald's room at ten twenty-six North Beckley Avenue
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	As McDonald fell into the seat with his left hand on the gun, he felt something graze across his hand and heard what sounded like the snap of the hammer.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	This reply of his contained no promise of immediate release.

VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	He then chose out near three thousand of the leading citizens and caused them to be crucified, while he allowed the remainder still to inhabit the city.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	and noted that Oswald's verbal and clerical potential was, quote, outstanding, end quote.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	and as he was to some extent when he returned to the United States.

VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	On November twenty a front page story reported that the streets on which the Presidential motorcade would travel included "Main and Stemmons Freeway."
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	no additional place would be created.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	to notify the Secret Service of the substantial information about Lee Harvey Oswald which the FBI had accumulated
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	It was from Oswald's right hand, in which he carried the long package as he walked from Frazier's car to the building.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	because the president of the photographic firm for which he had previously worked
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	Read the introduction to any of his inscriptions, of which the following is one, and you will call him vain and proud,
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	but when the two groups are traced downward they are found gradually to merge,
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	were fired from the southeast corner window of the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	The state side was the part stolen from the female felons' side.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	This Commission can recommend no procedures for the future protection of our Presidents which will guarantee security.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	As a blind for their new frauds, they set up as law-stationers in York Buildings, Adelphi, and at once commenced their nefarious traffic.

VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	He subsequently found a job with the Texas School Book Depository for which he performed his duties satisfactorily.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	The blow fell suddenly, and when least expected. One morning Mr. Fasson asked casually for certain certificates,

VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	Robert I. Bouck, special agent in charge of PRS,

VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	Inquiry into the character of Good exposed him as a loose liver, who "kept company" with several women.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	having first set apart their mothers, each man chose besides out of his whole household one woman whomsoever he pleased;
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	Tippit stopped the man and called him to his car.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	He then arrived on Thursday, November twenty-one, nineteen sixty-three, end quote.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	Another argument was, that it afforded more hope of the reformation of criminals.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	this was because of a defect in the scope which was recognized by the FBI agents and which they could have compensated for if they were aiming to hit a bull's-eye.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	The inmates, who euphemistically styled themselves "collegians,"
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	in the then existing state of the law,

VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	The regular daily visitation of the chaplain was also insisted upon.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	The route of the taxicab was retraced under the direction of Whaley.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	The instability of their relations was probably a function of the personalities of both people. Oswald was overbearing in relations with his wife.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	All these evils were set forth at length in the inspectors' first report.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	Such excellent returns might be counted upon, that a margin of profit would be left after the cost of the prisons had been defrayed.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	Oswald's defection was also the occasion for the opening of files by the Department of State, CIA, and the Office of Naval Intelligence.

VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	in the balance some work was done, but with the most meager results.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	Stombaugh testified that the colors, shades, and twist of the fibers found in the tuft on the rifle matched those in Oswald's shirt.
VirtualM4/reference_wav/sample_600.wav	He crept along the coast close in shore, looking for a quiet spot to cast away the ship,
